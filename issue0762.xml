<title><tt>std::unique_ptr</tt> requires complete type?</title>
<section><sref ref="[unique.ptr]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
In contrast to the proposed <tt>std::shared_ptr</tt>, <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt>
does currently not support incomplete types, because it
gives no explicit grant - thus instantiating <tt>unique_ptr</tt> with
an incomplete pointee type <tt>T</tt> automatically belongs to
undefined behaviour according to <sref ref="[res.on.functions]"/>&#47;2, last
bullet. This is an unnecessary restriction and prevents
many well-established patterns - like the bridge pattern - for <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt>.

<blockquote><p>
Move to open. The LWG is comfortable with the intent of allowing
incomplete types and making <tt>unique_ptr</tt> more like <tt>shared_ptr</tt>, but we are
not comfortable with the wording. The specification for <tt>unique_ptr</tt>
should be more like that of <tt>shared_ptr</tt>. We need to know, for individual
member functions, which ones require their types to be complete. The
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> specification is careful to say that for each function, and
we need the same level of care here. We also aren't comfortable with the
"part of the operational semantic" language; it's not used elsewhere in
the standard, and it's not clear what it means. We need a volunteer to
produce new wording.
</p></blockquote>

<resolution>
<p>
The proposed changes in the following revision refers to the current state of
N2521 including the assumption that <sref ref="[unique.ptr.compiletime]"/> will be removed
according to the current state of <iref ref="740"/>.
</p>
<p>
The specialization <tt>unique_ptr&lt;T[]&gt;</tt> has some more restrictive constraints on
type-completeness on <tt>T</tt> than <tt>unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</tt>. The following proposed wordings
try to cope with that. If the committee sees less usefulness on relaxed
constraints on <tt>unique_ptr&lt;T[]&gt;</tt>, the alternative would be to stop this relaxation
e.g. by adding one further bullet to <sref ref="[unique.ptr.runtime]"/>&#47;1:
"<tt>T</tt> shall be a complete type, if used as template argument of
<tt>unique_ptr&lt;T[], D&gt;</tt>
</p>
<p>
This issue has some overlap with <iref ref="673"/>, but it seems not to cause any
problems with this one,
because <iref ref="673"/> adds only optional requirements on <tt>D</tt> that do not conflict
with the here discussed
ones, provided that <tt>D::pointer</tt>'s operations (including default
construction, copy construction/assignment,
and pointer conversion) are specified <em>not</em> to throw, otherwise this
would have impact on the
current specification of <tt>unique_ptr</tt>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
In <sref ref="[unique.ptr]"/>&#47;2 add as the last sentence to the existing para:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The <tt>unique_ptr</tt> provides a semantics of strict ownership. A
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> owns the object it holds a pointer to. A
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> is not <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, nor
<tt>CopyAssignable</tt>, however it is <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt>. <ins>The template parameter <tt>T</tt> of
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> may be an incomplete type.</ins> [ <i>Note:</i> The
uses of <tt>unique_ptr</tt> include providing exception safety for
dynamically allcoated memory, passing ownership of dynamically allocated
memory to a function, and returning dynamically allocated memory from a
function. -- <i>end note</i> ]
</p></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.ctor]"/>&#47;1: No changes necessary.
</p>

<blockquote>
<note>
N.B.: We only need the requirement that <tt>D</tt> is <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
The current wording says just this.
</note>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
In <sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.ctor]"/>&#47;5 change the requires clause to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Requires:</i> <del>The expression <tt>D()(p)</tt> shall be well formed. The default constructor
of <tt>D</tt> shall not throw an exception.</del>
<del><tt>D</tt> must not be a reference type.</del>
<ins>
<tt>D</tt> shall be default constructible, and that construction
shall not throw an exception.
</ins>
</p>
<note>
N.B.: There is no need that the expression <tt>D()(p)</tt> is well-formed at
this point. I assume that the current wording is based on the
corresponding <tt>shared_ptr</tt> wording. In case of <tt>shared_ptr</tt> this
requirement is necessary, because the corresponding c'tor *can* fail
and must invoke delete <tt>p/d(p)</tt> in this case. <tt>Unique_ptr</tt> is simpler in
this regard. The *only* functions that must insist on well-formedness
and well-definedness of the expression <tt>get_deleter()(get())</tt> are (1)
the destructor and (2) <tt>reset</tt>. The reasoning for the wording change to
explicitly require <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> of <tt>D</tt> is to guarantee that
invocation of
<tt>D</tt>'s default c'tor is both well-formed and well-defined. Note also that
we do *not* need the
requirement that <tt>T</tt> must be complete, also in contrast to <tt>shared_ptr</tt>.
<tt>Shared_ptr</tt> needs this, because it's c'tor is a template c'tor which
potentially requires <tt>Convertible&lt;Y*, X*&gt;</tt>, which
again requires Completeness of <tt>Y</tt>, if <tt>!SameType&lt;X, Y&gt;</tt>

<li>
<p>
Merge <sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.ctor]"/>&#47;12+13 thereby removing the sentence
of 12, but transferring the "requires" to 13:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Requires:</i> If <tt>D</tt> is not an lvalue-reference type then[..]
</p>
<note>
N.B.: For the same reasons as for (3), there is no need that <tt>d(p)</tt> is
well-formed/well-defined at this point. The current wording guarantees
all what we need, namely that the initialization of both the <tt>T*</tt>
pointer and the <tt>D</tt> deleter are well-formed and well-defined.
</note>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.ctor]"/>&#47;17: No changes necessary.
</li>
<li>
<p><sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.ctor]"/>&#47;21:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> If <tt>D</tt> is not a reference type, construction of
the deleter <tt>D</tt> from an rvalue of type <tt>E</tt> shall be well
formed and shall not throw an exception. If <tt>D</tt> is a reference
type, then <tt>E</tt> shall be the same type as <tt>D</tt> (diagnostic
required). <tt>U*</tt> shall be implicitly convertible to <tt>T*</tt>.
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> These requirements imply that <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt>
be complete types. <i>-- end note</i>]</ins>
</p></blockquote>

<note>
N.B.: The current wording of 21 already implicitly guarantees that <tt>U</tt>
is completely defined, because it requires that <tt>Convertible&lt;U*, T*&gt;</tt> is
true. If the committee wishes this explicit requirement can be added,
e.g. "<tt>U</tt> shall be a complete type."
</note>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.dtor]"/>: Just before p1 add a new paragraph:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Requires:</i> The expression <tt>get_deleter()(get())</tt> shall be well-formed,
shall have well-defined behavior, and shall not throw exceptions.
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> The use of <tt>default_delete</tt> requires <tt>T</tt> to
be a complete type. <i>-- end note</i>]</ins>
</p>
<note>
N.B.: This requirement ensures that the whole responsibility on
type-completeness of <tt>T</tt> is delegated to this expression.
</note>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.asgn]"/>&#47;1: No changes necessary, except the
current editorial issue, that "must shall" has to be changed to
"shall", but this change is not a special part of this resolution.
</p>

<note>
N.B. The current wording is sufficient, because we can delegate all
further requirements on the requirements of the effects clause
</note>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.asgn]"/>&#47;6:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> Assignment of the deleter <tt>D</tt> from an rvalue
<tt>D</tt> shall not throw an exception. <tt>U*</tt> shall be implicitly
convertible to <tt>T*</tt>.
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> These requirements imply that <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt>
be complete types. <i>-- end note</i>]</ins>
</p></blockquote>

<note>
N.B.: The current wording of p. 6 already implicitly guarantees that
<tt>U</tt> is completely defined, because it requires that <tt>Convertible&lt;U*, T*&gt;</tt>
is true, see (6)+(8).

<li>

<sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.asgn]"/>&#47;11: No changes necessary.
