<p>
Tables 53 and 54 in <sref ref="[locale.codecvt.byname]"/> are both titled "convert
result values," when surely "do_in/do_out result values" must have
been intended for Table 53 and "do_unshift result values" for Table
54.
</p>
<p>
Table 54, row 3 says that the meaning of partial is "more characters
needed to be supplied to complete termination." The function is not
supplied any characters, it is given a buffer which it fills with
characters or, more precisely, destination elements (i.e., an escape
sequence). So partial means that space for more than (to_limit - to)
destination elements was needed to terminate a sequence given the
value of state.

<p>
Change the title of Table 53 to "do_in/do_out result values" and
the title of Table 54 to "do_unshift result values."
</p>
<p>
Change the text in Table 54, row 3 (the <b>partial</b> row), under the
heading Meaning, to "space for more than (to_limit - to) destination
elements was needed to terminate a sequence given the value of state."
