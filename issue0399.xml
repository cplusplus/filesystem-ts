  <title>volations of unformatted input function requirements</title>

    <p>
The Effects clauses for the two functions below violate the
general requirements on unformatted input functions outlined
in 27.6.1.3: they do not begin by constructing a sentry object.
Instead, they begin by calling widen ('\n'), which may throw
an exception. The exception is then allowed to propagate from
the unformatted input function irrespective of the setting of
exceptions().
    </p>
    <p>
Note that in light of 27.6.1.1, p3 and p4, the fact that the
functions allow exceptions thrown from widen() to propagate
may not strictly speaking be a defect (but the fact that the
functions do not start by constructing a sentry object still
is). However, since an exception thrown from ctype&lt;charT>
::widen() during any other input operation (say, from within
a call to num_get&lt;charT>::get()) will be caught and cause
badbit to be set, these two functions should not be treated
differently for the sake of consistency.

<p>
Not a defect.  The standard is consistent, and the behavior required
by the standard is unambiguous.  Yes, it's theoretically possible for
widen to throw.  (Not that this will happen for the default ctype
facet or for most real-world replacement ctype facets.)  Users who
define ctype facets that can throw, and who care about this behavior,
can use alternative signatures that don't call widen.
