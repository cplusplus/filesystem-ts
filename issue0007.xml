<discussion>
<p>(1) In <sref ref="[string::insert]"/>, the description of template
&lt;class InputIterator&gt; insert(iterator, InputIterator,
InputIterator) makes no sense. It refers to a member function that
doesn't exist. It also talks about the return value of a void
function. </p>

<p>(2) Several versions of basic_string::replace don't appear in the
class synopsis. </p>

<p>(3) basic_string::push_back appears in the synopsis, but is never
described elsewhere.  In the synopsis its argument is const charT,
which doesn't makes much sense; it should probably be charT, or
possible const charT&amp;. </p>

<p>(4) basic_string::pop_back is missing. </p>

<p>(5) int compare(size_type pos, size_type n1, charT* s, size_type n2
= npos) make no sense. First, it's const charT* in the synopsis and
charT* in the description. Second, given what it says in RETURNS,
leaving out the final argument will always result in an exception
getting thrown. This is paragraphs 5 and 6 of 
<sref ref="[string::swap]"/></p>

<p>(6) In table 37, in section <sref ref="[char.traits.require]"/>,
there's a note for X::move(s, p, n). It says &quot;Copies correctly
even where p is in [s, s+n)&quot;. This is correct as far as it goes,
but it doesn't go far enough; it should also guarantee that the copy
is correct even where s in in [p, p+n). These are two orthogonal
guarantees, and neither one follows from the other. Both guarantees
are necessary if X::move is supposed to have the same sort of
semantics as memmove (which was clearly the intent), and both
guarantees are necessary if X::move is actually supposed to be
useful. </p>

<resolution>
<p>ITEM 1: In 21.3.5.4 [lib.string::insert], change paragraph 16 to <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EFFECTS: Equivalent to insert(p - begin(), basic_string(first, last)).<br/>
<br/>
ITEM 2:&nbsp; Not a defect; the Standard is clear.. There are ten versions of replace() in
the synopsis, and ten versions in 21.3.5.6 [lib.string::replace].<br/>
<br/>
ITEM 3: Change the declaration of push_back in the string synopsis (21.3,
[lib.basic.string]) from:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void push_back(const charT)<br/>
<br/>
to<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void push_back(charT)<br/>
<br/>
Add the following text immediately after 21.3.5.2 [lib.string::append], paragraph 10.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void basic_string::push_back(charT c);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EFFECTS: Equivalent to append(static_cast&lt;size_type&gt;(1), c);<br/>
<br/>
ITEM 4: Not a defect. The omission appears to have been deliberate.<br/>
<br/>
ITEM 5: Duplicate; see issue 5 (and 87).<br/>
<br/>
ITEM 6: In table 37, Replace:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Copies correctly even where p is in [s, s+n).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
with:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Copies correctly even where the ranges [p, p+n) and [s,
s+n) overlap.&quot;</p>
