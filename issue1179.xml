While reviewing <iref ref="971"/> I noted that <sref
ref="[structure.specifications]"/>/7 says:
</p>

<blockquote>
-7- Error conditions specify conditions where a function may fail. The
conditions are listed, together with a suitable explanation, as the <tt>enum
class errc</tt> constants (19.5) that could be used as an argument to
function <tt>make_error_condition</tt> (19.5.3.6).
</blockquote>

<p>
This paragraph should mention <tt>make_error_code</tt> or the text "that
could be used as an argument to function <tt>make_error_condition</tt>
(19.5.3.6)" should be deleted.  I believe this is editorial.

<p>
I'm not convinced there's a problem there, because as far as the "Error
conditions" clauses are concerned, make_error_condition() is used by a
user to test for the condition, whereas make_error_code is not. For
example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void foobar(error_code& ec = throws());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
 Error conditions:
</p>
<blockquote>
permission_denied - Insufficient privilege to perform operation.
</blockquote>

<p>
When a user writes:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
error_code ec;
foobar(ec);
if (ec == errc::permission_denied)
   ...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
the implicit conversion <tt>errc-&gt;error_condition</tt> makes the if-test
equivalent to:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
if (ec == make_error_condition(errc::permission_denied))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, if the user had written:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
if (ec == make_error_code(errc::permission_denied))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
the test is now checking for a specific error code. The test may
evaluate to <tt>false</tt> even though <tt>foobar()</tt> failed due to the documented
error condition "Insufficient privilege".

<p>
NAD Editorial.
</p>
<p>
What the WP says right now is literally true: these codes can be used as
an argument to <tt>make_error_condition</tt>. (It is also true that they can be
used as an argument to <tt>make_error_code</tt>, which the WP doesn't say.) Maybe
it would be clearer to just delete "that could be used as an argument to
function <tt>make_error_condition</tt>", since that fact is already implied by
other things that we say. We believe that this is editorial.
