<title>Incorrect requirements for <tt>lock_guard</tt> and <tt>unique_lock</tt></title>

<p>
There are two different <tt>*Lockable</tt> requirements imposed on template arguments
of the class template <tt>lock_guard</tt> as of <sref ref="[thread.lock.guard]"/> p. 1+2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
1 [..] The supplied <tt>Mutex</tt> type shall meet the <tt>BasicLockable</tt> requirements (30.2.5.2).
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
2 The supplied <tt>Mutex</tt> type shall meet the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements (30.2.5.3).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements include the availability of a member function <tt>try_lock()</tt>,
but there is no operational semantics in the specification of <tt>lock_guard</tt> that would rely
on such a function. It seems to me that paragraph 2 should be removed.
<p/>
Similarly, <sref ref="[thread.lock.unique]"/> p. 1+2 refer to exactly the same two requirements.
In this case it seems as if the intention was that the template arguement <tt>Mutex</tt> should
always provide the <tt>try_lock()</tt> member function, because several member functions of
<tt>unique_lock</tt> (<tt>unique_lock(mutex_type&amp; m, try_to_lock_t)</tt> or <tt>bool try_lock()</tt>) 
take advantage of such a function without adding extra requirements for this.
It seems that the requirement subset <tt>BasicLockable</tt> should be removed.
<p/>
I searched for further possible misusages of the <tt>*Lockable</tt> requirements, but could not
find any more.
</p>

<note>2011-02-23</note>

<p>Howard suggests an alternative approach in regard to <tt>unique_lock</tt>: The current
minimum requirements on its template argument should better be reduced to <tt>BasicLockable</tt> 
instead of the current <tt>Lockable</tt>, including ammending member-wise constraints where required. 
This suggestions was supported by Anthony, Daniel, and Pablo.
<p/>
Daniel drafts wording that follows this separation strategy.

<resolution>
<p>
The suggested wording changes are against the working draft N3225.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove <sref ref="[thread.lock.guard]"/> p. 2 completely:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<del>2 The supplied <tt>Mutex</tt> type shall meet the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements (30.2.5.3).</del>
</p></blockquote>

</li>

<li>
<p>Change <sref ref="[thread.lock.unique]"/> p. 1-3 as indicated. The intend is to make <tt>BasicLockable</tt>
the fundamental requirement for <tt>unique_lock</tt>. We also update the note to reflect these changes and
synchronize one remaining reference of 'mutex' by the proper term 'lockable object' in sync
to the wording changes of <tt>lock_guard</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
1 [..] The behavior of a program is undefined if the contained pointer <tt>pm</tt> is not null
and the <del>mutex</del><ins>lockable object</ins> pointed to by <tt>pm</tt> does not exist for the entire remaining lifetime (3.8) 
of the <tt>unique_lock</tt> object. The supplied <tt>Mutex</tt> type shall meet the 
<tt>BasicLockable</tt> requirements (30.2.5.2). <del>[Editor's note:
BasicLockable is redundant, since the following additional paragraph requires Lockable.]</del>
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<del>2 The supplied <tt>Mutex</tt> type shall meet the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements (30.2.5.3).</del>
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
3 [ <i>Note</i>: <tt>unique_lock&lt;Mutex&gt;</tt> meets the <tt><ins>Basic</ins>Lockable</tt> requirements. If 
<ins><tt>Mutex</tt> meets the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements ([thread.req.lockable.req]), <tt>unique_lock&lt;Mutex&gt;</tt> 
also meets the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements and if</ins> <tt>Mutex</tt> meets the <tt>TimedLockable</tt> 
requirements (30.2.5.4), <tt>unique_lock&lt;Mutex&gt;</tt> also meets the <tt>TimedLockable</tt> 
requirements. &mdash; <i>end note</i> ]
</p></blockquote>

</li>

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[thread.lock.unique.cons]"/> to add the now necessary member-wise
additional constraints for <tt>Lockable</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
unique_lock(mutex_type&amp; m, try_to_lock_t) noexcept;
</pre><blockquote><p>
8 <i>Requires</i>: <ins>The supplied <tt>Mutex</tt> type shall meet the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements ([thread.req.lockable.req]).</ins> 
If <tt>mutex_type</tt> is not a recursive mutex the calling thread does not own the mutex.
<p/>
9 <i>Effects</i>: Constructs an object of type <tt>unique_lock</tt> and calls <tt>m.try_lock()</tt>.
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[thread.lock.unique.locking]"/> to add the now necessary member-wise
additional constraints for <tt>Lockable</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
bool try_lock();
</pre><blockquote><p>
<ins>? <i>Requires</i>: The supplied <tt>Mutex</tt> type shall meet the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements ([thread.req.lockable.req]).</ins> 
<p/>
4 <i>Effects</i>: <tt>pm-&gt;try_lock()</tt>
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
