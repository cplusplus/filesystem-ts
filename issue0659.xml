<discussion>
<p>
Greg Herlihy has clearly demonstrated that a user defined input
iterator should have an <tt>operator-&gt;()</tt>, even if its
value type is a built-in type (comp.std.c++, "Re: Should any iterator
have an <tt>operator-&gt;()</tt> in C++0x?", March 2007).  And as Howard
Hinnant remarked in the same thread that the input iterator
<tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> doesn't have one, this must be a
defect!
</p>
<p>
Based on Greg's example, the following code demonstrates the issue:
</p><pre>
 #include &lt;iostream&gt; 
 #include &lt;fstream&gt;
 #include &lt;streambuf&gt; 

 typedef char C;
 int main ()
 {
   std::ifstream s("filename", std::ios::in);
   std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt; i(s);

   (*i).~C();  // This is well-formed...
   i-&gt;~C();  // ... so this should be supported!
 }
</pre>
<p>
Of course, <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> is also needed when the <tt>value_type</tt> of
<tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> is a class.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> could be implemented in various ways.  For instance,
by storing the current value inside the iterator, and returning its
address.  Or by returning a proxy, like <tt>operator_arrow_proxy</tt>, from
<a href="http://www.boost.org/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp">http://www.boost.org/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp</a>
</p>
<p>
I hope that the resolution of this issue will contribute to getting a
clear and consistent definition of iterator concepts.
</p>

<note>
Kona (2007): The proposed resolution is inconsistent because the return
type of <tt>istreambuf_iterator::operator-&gt;()</tt> is specified to be <tt>pointer</tt>,
but the proposed text also states that "<tt>operator-&gt;</tt> may return a proxy."

Niels Dekker (mailed to Howard Hinnant):
</note>
<blockquote>
<p>
The proposed resolution does
not seem inconsistent to me. <tt>istreambuf_iterator::operator-&gt;()</tt> should
have <tt>istreambuf_iterator::pointer</tt> as return type, and this return type
may in fact be a proxy.
</p>
<p>
AFAIK, the resolution of <iref ref="445"/> ("<tt>iterator_traits::reference</tt>
unspecified for some iterator categories") implies that for any iterator
class <tt>Iter</tt>, the return type of <tt>operator-&gt;()</tt> is <tt>Iter::pointer</tt>, by
definition.  I don't think <tt>Iter::pointer</tt> needs to be a raw pointer.
</p>
<p>
Still I wouldn't mind if the text "<tt>operator-&gt;</tt> may return a proxy" would
be removed from the resolution. I think it's up to the library
implementation, how to implement <tt>istreambuf_iterator::operator-&gt;()</tt>.  As
longs as it behaves as expected: <tt>i-&gt;m</tt> should have the same effect as
<tt>(*i).m</tt>. Even for an explicit destructor call, <tt>i-&gt;~C()</tt>.  The main issue
is just: <tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> should have an <tt>operator-&gt;()</tt>!

Note that <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> is now a requirement in the <tt>InputIterator</tt> concept, so
this issue cannot be ignored or existing valid programs will break when
compiled with an 0x library.

<blockquote>
<p>
I agree with the observation that in principle the type 'pointer' may be a
proxy, and the words highlighting this are redundant.
</p>
<p>
However, in the current draught <tt>pointer</tt> is required to be exactly '<tt>charT *</tt>'
by the derivation from <tt>std::iterator</tt>.  At a minimum, the 4th parameter of
this base class template should become unspecified.  That permits the
introduction of a proxy as a nested class in some further undocumented (not
even exposition-only) base.
</p>
<p>
It also permits the <tt>istream_iterator</tt> approach where the cached value is
stored in the iterator itself, and the iterator serves as its own proxy for
post-increment <tt>operator++</tt> - removing the need for the existing
exposition-only nested class <tt>proxy</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Note that the current <tt>proxy</tt> class also has exactly the right properties to
serve as the pointer <tt>proxy</tt> too.  This is likely to be a common case where an
<tt>InputIterator</tt> does not hold internal state but delegates to another class.
</p>
<p>
Proposed Resolution:
</p>
<p>
In addition to the current proposal:
</p>
<p>
<sref ref="[istreambuf.iterator]"/>
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class charT, class traits = char_traits&lt;charT&gt; &gt;
class istreambuf_iterator
  : public iterator&lt;input_iterator_tag, charT,
                    typename traits::off_type, <del>charT*</del> <ins><i>unspecified</i></ins>, charT&gt; {
</pre></blockquote>

<resolution>
<p>
Add to the synopsis in <sref ref="[istreambuf.iterator]"/>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
charT operator*() const;
<ins>pointer operator-&gt;() const;</ins>
istreambuf_iterator&lt;charT,traits&gt;&amp; operator++();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<sref ref="[istreambuf.iterator]"/>
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class charT, class traits = char_traits&lt;charT&gt; &gt;
class istreambuf_iterator
  : public iterator&lt;input_iterator_tag, charT,
                    typename traits::off_type, <del>charT*</del> <ins><i>unspecified</i></ins>, charT&gt; {
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Change <sref ref="[istreambuf.iterator]"/>, p1:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The class template <tt>istreambuf_iterator</tt> reads successive
characters from the <tt>streambuf</tt> for which it was constructed.
<tt>operator*</tt> provides access to the current input character, if
any. <ins>[<i>Note:</i> <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> may return a proxy. &mdash;
<i>end note</i>]</ins> Each time
<tt>operator++</tt> is evaluated, the iterator advances to the next
input character. If the end of stream is reached
(<tt>streambuf_type::sgetc()</tt> returns <tt>traits::eof()</tt>), the
iterator becomes equal to the end of stream iterator value. The default
constructor <tt>istreambuf_iterator()</tt> and the constructor
<tt>istreambuf_iterator(0)</tt> both construct an end of stream iterator
object suitable for use as an end-of-range.
