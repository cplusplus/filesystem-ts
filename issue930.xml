<title>Access to std::array data as built-in array type</title>
<section><sref ref="[array]"/></section>
<submitter>Niels Dekker</submitter>
<date>17 Nov 2008</date>

<discussion>

<p>
The Working Draft (N2798) allows access to the elements of
<tt>std::array</tt> by its <tt>data()</tt> member function:
</p>

<blockquote>

<h5>23.2.1.4 array::data [array.data]</h5>
<pre>
 T *data();
 const T *data() const;
</pre>
<ol><li>
 Returns: elems.
</li></ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, the result of <tt>std::array::data()</tt> cannot be bound
to a reference to a built-in array of the type of <tt>array::elems</tt>.
And <tt>std::array</tt> provides no other way to get a reference to
<tt>array::elems</tt>. 
This hampers the use of <tt>std::array</tt>, for example when trying to
pass its data to a C style API function:
</p>

<pre>
 // Some C style API function. 
 void set_path( char (*)[MAX_PATH] );

 std::array&lt;char,MAX_PATH&gt; path;
 set_path( path.data() );  // error
 set_path( &amp;(path.data()) );  // error
</pre>

 <p>
Another example, trying to pass the array data to an instance of another
C++ class:
</p>

<pre>
 // Represents a 3-D point in space.
 class three_d_point {
 public:
   explicit three_d_point(const double (&amp;)[3]); 
 };

 const std::array&lt;double,3&gt; coordinates = { 0, 1, 2 };
 three_d_point point1( coordinates.data() );  // error.
 three_d_point point2( *(coordinates.data()) );  // error.
</pre>

<p>
A user might be tempted to use <tt>std::array::elems</tt> instead, but
doing so isn't recommended, because <tt>std::array::elems</tt> is "for
exposition only".  Note that Boost.Array users might already use
<tt>boost::array::elems</tt>, as its documentation doesn't explicitly
state that <tt>boost::array::elems</tt> is for exposition only:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/doc/html/boost/array.html
</p>
<p>
I can think of three options to solve this issue:
</p>
<ol><li>
Remove the words "exposition only" from the definition of
<tt>std::array::elems</tt>, as well as the note saying that "elems is
shown for exposition only."
</li><li>
Change the signature of <tt>std::array::data()</tt>, so that it would
return a reference to the built-in array, instead of a pointer to its
first element.
</li><li>
Add extra member functions, returning a reference to the built-in array.
</li></ol>
<p>
Lawrence Crowl wrote me that it might be better to leave
<tt>std::array::elems</tt> "for exposition only", to allow alternate
representations to allocate the array data dynamically.  This might be
of interest to the embedded community, having to deal with very limited
stack sizes.
</p>
<p>
The second option, changing the return type of
<tt>std::array::data()</tt>, would break backward compatible to current
Boost and TR1 implementations, as well as to the other contiguous
container (<tt>vector</tt> and <tt>string</tt>) in a very subtle way.
For example, the following call to <tt>std::swap</tt> currently swap two
locally declared pointers <tt>(data1, data2)</tt>, for any container
type <tt>T</tt> that has a <tt>data()</tt> member function. When
<tt>std::array::data()</tt> is changed to return a reference, the
<tt>std::swap</tt> call may swap the container elements instead.
</p>

<pre>
 template &lt;typename T&gt;
 void func(T&amp; container1, T&amp; container2)
 {
   // Are data1 and data2 pointers or references?
   auto data1 = container1.data();
   auto data2 = container2.data();

   // Will this swap two local pointers, or all container elements?
   std::swap(data1, data2);
 }
</pre>

<p>
The following concept is currently satisfied by all contiguous
containers, but it no longer is for <tt>std::array</tt>, when
<tt>array::data()</tt>
is changed to return a reference (tested on ConceptGCC Alpha 7):
</p>

<pre>
 auto concept ContiguousContainerConcept&lt;typename T&gt;
 {
   typename value_type = typename T::value_type;
   const value_type * T::data() const;
 }
</pre>

<p>
Still it's worth considering having <tt>std::array::data()</tt> return a
reference, because it might be the most intuitive option, from a user's
point of view.  Nicolai Josuttis (who wrote <tt>boost::array</tt>)
mailed me that he very much prefers this option.
</p>
<p>
Note that for this option, the definition of <tt>data()</tt> would also
need to be revised for zero-sized arrays, as its return type cannot be a
reference to a zero-sized built-in array.  Regarding zero-sized array,
<tt>data()</tt> could throw an exception.  Or there could be a partial
specialization of <tt>std::array</tt> where <tt>data()</tt> returns
<tt>T*</tt> or gets removed.
</p>
<p>
Personally I prefer the third option, adding a new member function to
<tt>std::array</tt>, overloaded for const and non-const access,
returning a reference to the built-in array, to avoid those compatible
issues. I'd propose naming the function <tt>std::array::c_array()</tt>,
which sounds intuitive to me. Note that <tt>boost::array</tt> already
has a <tt>c_array()</tt> member, returning a pointer, but Nicolai told
me that this one is only there for historical reasons. (Otherwise a name
like <tt>std::array::native_array()</tt> or
<tt>std::array::builtin_array()</tt> would also be fine with me.) 
According to my proposed resolution, a zero-sized <tt>std::array</tt> does not need
to have <tt>c_array()</tt>, while it is still required to have
<tt>data()</tt> functions.

Alisdair: Don't like p4 suggesting implementation-defined behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Walter: What about an explicit conversion operator, instead of adding
the new member function?
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: Noodling about:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;size_t N, ValueType T&gt;
struct array
{
  T elems[N];

// fantasy code starts here

// crazy decltype version for grins only
//requires True&lt;(N&gt;0)&gt;
//explict operator decltype(elems) &amp; () { return elems; }

// conversion to lvalue ref
requires True&lt;(N&gt;0)&gt;
explict operator T(&amp;)[N] () &amp; { return elems; }

explict operator const T(&amp;)[N] () const &amp; { return elems; }

// conversion to rvalue ref using ref qualifiers

explict operator T(&amp;&amp;)[N] () &amp;&amp; { return elems; }

// fantasy code ends here

explicit operator bool() { return true; }

<p>
This seems legal but odd. Jason Merrill says currently a CWG issue 613
on the non-static data member that fixes the error that current G++
gives for the non-explicit, non-conceptualized version of this. Verdict
from human compiler: seems legal.
</p>
<p>
Some grumbling about zero-sized arrays being allowed and supported.
</p>
<p>
Walter: Would this address the issue? Are we inclined to go this route?
</p>
<p>
Alan: What would usage look like?
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// 3-d point in space
struct three_d_point
{
  explicit three_d_point(const double (&amp;)[3]);
};

void sink(double*);

const std::array&lt;double, 3&gt; coordinates = { 0, 1, 2 };
three_d_point point1( coordinates.data() ); //error
three_d_point point2( *(coordinates.data()) ); // error
three_d_point point3( coordinates ); // yay!

sink(cooridinates); // error, no conversion
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Recommended Open with new wording. Take the required clause and add the
explicit conversion operators, not have a <tt>typedef</tt>. At issue still is use
<tt>decltype</tt> or use <tt>T[N]</tt>. In favour of using <tt>T[N]</tt>, even though use of
<tt>decltype</tt> is specially clever.

<blockquote>
<p>
The idea to resolve the issue by adding explicit conversion operators
was abandoned, because it would be inconvenient to use, especially when
passing the array to a template function, as mentioned by Daniel. So we
reconsidered the original proposed resolution, which appeared
acceptable, except for its proposed changes to <sref ref="[array.zero]"/>, which
allowed <tt>c_array_type</tt> and <tt>c_array()</tt> to be absent for a zero-sized array.
Alisdair argued that such wording would disallow certain generic use
cases. New wording for <sref ref="[array.zero]"/> was agreed upon (Howard: and
is reflected in the proposed resolution).
</p>
<p>
Move to Review

<blockquote>
<p>
I will be unhappy voting the proposed resolution for 930 past review
until we have implementation experience with reference qualifiers. 
Specifically, I want to understand the impact of the missing overload
for <tt>const &amp;&amp;</tt> (if any.)
</p>

<p>
If we think the issue is important enough it might be worthwhile
stripping the ref qualifiers for easy progress next meeting, and opening
yet another issue to put them back with experience.
</p>

<p>
Recommend deferring any decision on splitting the issue until we get LWG
feedback next meeting - I may be the lone dissenting voice if others are
prepared to proceed without it.

Mark as NAD. There was not enough consensus that this was sufficiently
useful. There are known other ways to do this, such as small inline
conversion functions.
