    <p>
While reviewing unformatted input member functions of istream
for their behavior when they encounter end-of-file during input
I found that the requirements vary, sometimes unexpectedly, and
in more than one case even contradict established practice (GNU
libstdc++ 3.2, IBM VAC++ 6.0, STLPort 4.5, SunPro 5.3, HP aCC
5.38, Rogue Wave libstd 3.1, and Classic Iostreams).
    </p>
    <p>
The following unformatted input member functions set eofbit if they
encounter an end-of-file (this is the expected behavior, and also
the behavior of all major implementations):
    </p>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    get (char_type*, streamsize, char_type);
    </pre>
    <p>
    Also sets failbit if it fails to extract any characters.
    </p>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    get (char_type*, streamsize);
    </pre>
    <p>
    Also sets failbit if it fails to extract any characters.
    </p>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    getline (char_type*, streamsize, char_type);
    </pre>
    <p>
    Also sets failbit if it fails to extract any characters.
    </p>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    getline (char_type*, streamsize);
    </pre>
    <p>
    Also sets failbit if it fails to extract any characters.
    </p>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    ignore (int, int_type);
    </pre>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    read (char_type*, streamsize);
    </pre>
    <p>
    Also sets failbit if it encounters end-of-file.
    </p>
    <pre>
    streamsize readsome (char_type*, streamsize);
    </pre>

    <p>
The following unformated input member functions set failbit but
not eofbit if they encounter an end-of-file (I find this odd
since the functions make it impossible to distinguish a general
failure from a failure due to end-of-file; the requirement is
also in conflict with all major implementation which set both
eofbit and failbit):
    </p>
    <pre>
    int_type get();
    </pre>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    get (char_type&amp;);
    </pre>
    <p>
These functions only set failbit of they extract no characters,
otherwise they don't set any bits, even on failure (I find this
inconsistency quite unexpected; the requirement is also in
conflict with all major implementations which set eofbit
whenever they encounter end-of-file):
    </p>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    get (basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits>&amp;, char_type);
    </pre>
    <pre>
    basic_istream&lt;charT, traits>&amp;
    get (basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits>&amp;);
    </pre>
    <p>
This function sets no bits (all implementations except for
STLport and Classic Iostreams set eofbit when they encounter
end-of-file):
    </p>
    <pre>
    int_type peek ();
    </pre>
<p>Informally, what we want is a global statement of intent saying
  that eofbit gets set if we trip across EOF, and then we can take
  away the specific wording for individual functions.  A full review
  is necessary.  The wording currently in the standard is a mishmash,
  and changing it on an individual basis wouldn't make things better.
  Dietmar will do this work.</p>
