<p>
Albeit shared mutex types refine timed mutex types, the requirements imposed on the corresponding required member function
expressions are inconsistent in several aspects, most probably because failing synchronisation with wording changes for
timed mutexes applied by some issues:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Due to acceptance of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3568.html">N3568</a> a wording phrase
came in <sref ref="[thread.sharedmutex.requirements]"/> p26,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects:</i> If the tick period of <tt>rel_time</tt> is not exactly convertible to the native tick period, the
duration shall be rounded up to the nearest native tick period. [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p> 
while a very similar one had been removed for <sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/> by LWG <iref href="2091"/>. 
<p/>
Having this guaranteed effect for <tt>try_lock_shared_for</tt> but not for <tt>try_lock_for</tt> seems inconsistent
and astonishing.
<p/>
If the actual intended restriction imposed onto the implementation is to forbid early wakeups here, we should ensure that
to hold for timed mutex's <tt>try_lock_for</tt> as well. Note that the rationale provided for LWG <iref href="2091"/> was
a potential late wakeup situation, but it seems that there is no implementation restriction that prevents early wakeups.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The shared-lock requirements for any <tt>*lock*()</tt> functions don't provide the guarantee that "If an exception is thrown then 
a lock shall not have been acquired for the current execution agent.". For other mutex types this guarantee can be derived from
the corresponding <tt>TimedLockable</tt> requirements, but there are no <tt>SharedLockable</tt> requirements.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The shared-lock requirements for <tt>*lock_for/_until()</tt> functions require "<i>Throws:</i> Nothing."
instead of "<i>Throws:</i> Timeout-related exceptions (30.2.4)." which had been added by LWG <iref href="2093"/>, because user-provided
clocks, durations, or time points may throw exceptions. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
With the addition of <tt>std::shared_mutex</tt>, the explicit lists of <sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]"/> p7+15,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> If <tt>m</tt> is of type <tt>std::mutex</tt> or <tt>std::timed_mutex</tt>, the calling thread does not own the mutex.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and of <sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/> p4+11,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> If <tt>m</tt> is of type <tt>std::timed_mutex</tt>, the calling thread does not own the mutex.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
are incomplete and should add the non-recursive <tt>std::shared_mutex</tt> as well.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]"/> p7+15 as indicated:</p>
