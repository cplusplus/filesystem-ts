Table 55 &mdash; Clock Requirements (in <sref ref="[time.clock.req]"/>)
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>
the requirements for <tt>C1::time_point</tt> require <tt>C1</tt> and <tt>C2</tt>
to "refer to the same epoch", but "epoch" is not defined.
</li>
<li>
"Different clocks may share a <tt>time_point</tt> definition if it is
valid to compare their <tt>time_point</tt>s by comparing their
respective <tt>duration</tt>s." What does "valid" mean here? And, since
<tt>C1::rep</tt> is "**THE** representation type of the native
<tt>duration</tt> and <tt>time_point</tt>" (emphasis added), there
doesn't seem to be much room for some other representation.
</li>
<li>
<tt>C1::is_monotonic</tt> has type "<tt>const bool</tt>". The
"<tt>const</tt>" should be removed.
</li>
<li>
<tt>C1::period</tt> has type <tt>ratio</tt>. <tt>ratio</tt> isn't a type, 
it's a template. What is the required type?
</li>

<li>
<p>
"epoch" is purposefully not defined beyond the common English
<a href="http://www.dictionary.net/epoch">definition</a>.  The C standard
also chose not to define epoch, though POSIX did.  I believe it is a strength
of the C standard that epoch is not defined.  When it is known that two <tt>time_point</tt>s
refer to the same epoch, then a definition of the epoch is not needed to compare
the two <tt>time_point</tt>s, or subtract them.
</p>
<p>
A <tt>time_point</tt> and a <tt>Clock</tt> implicitly refer to an (unspecified) epoch.
The <tt>time_point</tt> represents an offset (<tt>duration</tt>) from an epoch.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The sentence:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Different clocks 
may share a <tt>time_point</tt>
definition if it is valid to 
compare their <tt>time_point</tt>s by 
comparing their respective 
<tt>duration</tt>s.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
is redundant and could be removed.  I believe the sentence which follows the above:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<tt>C1</tt> and <tt>C2</tt> shall refer to the same epoch.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
is sufficient.  If two clocks share the same epoch, then by definition, comparing
their <tt>time_point</tt>s is valid.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<tt>is_monotonic</tt> is meant to never change (be <tt>const</tt>).  It is also
desired that this value be usable in compile-time computation and branching.
</li>
<li>
<p>
This should probably instead be worded:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An instantiation of <tt>ratio</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
</li>

Batavia (2009-05):
</note>
<blockquote>
<p>
Re (a): It is not clear to us whether "epoch" is a term of art.
</p>
<p>
Re (b), (c), and (d):  We agree with Howard's comments,
and would consider adding to (c) a <tt>static constexpr</tt> requirement.
</p>
<p>
Move to Open pending proposed wording.

<blockquote><p>
In regards to (d) I suggest to say "a specialization of ratio" instead of
"An instantiation of ratio". This seems to be the better matching standard
core language term for this kind of entity.

<p>
Regarding (a), I found this paper on the ISO website using the term "epoch" consistently with the current wording:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/C030811e_FILES/MAIN_C030811e/text/ISOIEC_18026E_TEMPORAL_CS.HTM">http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/C030811e_FILES/MAIN_C030811e/text/ISOIEC_18026E_TEMPORAL_CS.HTM</a>
</p>
<p>
which is part of ISO/IEC 18026 "Information technology -- Spatial Reference Model (SRM)".

2009-08-01 Howard: Moved to Reivew as the wording requested in Batavia has been provided.

<p>
Change <sref ref="[time.clock.req]"/> p1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- A clock is a bundle consisting of a native <tt>duration</tt>, a native <tt>time_point</tt>, and a function <tt>now()</tt> to get the

section 6.3 of ISO/IEC 18026.</ins>
