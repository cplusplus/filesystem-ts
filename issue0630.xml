Section <sref ref="[numeric.requirements]"/>, p1     suggests     that     a
<code>valarray</code>  specialization on  a  type <code>T</code>  that
satisfies  the requirements enumerated  in the  paragraph is  itself a
valid  type   on  which  <code>valarray</code>   may  be  instantiated
(Footnote       269        makes       this       clear).        I.e.,
<code>valarray&lt;valarray&lt;T&gt;  &gt;</code> is  valid as  long as
<code>T</code>   is   valid.    However,  since   implementations   of
<code>valarray</code> are permitted to initialize storage allocated by
the class by  invoking the default ctor of  <code>T</code> followed by
the    copy    assignment    operator,   such    implementations    of
<code>valarray</code>   wouldn't  work  with   (perhaps  user-defined)
specializations of <code>valarray</code> whose assignment operator had
undefined behavior when the size of its argument didn't match the size
of <code>*this</code>.  By <i>"wouldn't work"</i> I mean that it would
be  impossible  to resize  such  an array  of  arrays  by calling  the
<code>resize()</code> member  function on it if the  function used the
copy  assignment operator  after constructing  all elements  using the
default  ctor (e.g.,  by invoking  <code>new  value_type[N]</code>) to
obtain default-initialized storage) as it's permitted to do.

        </p>
        <p>

Stated      more     generally,      the      problem     is      that
<code>valarray&lt;valarray&lt;T&gt;  &gt;::resize(size_t)</code> isn't
required or  guaranteed to have well-defined semantics  for every type
<code>T</code>     that      satisfies     all     requirements     in
<sref ref="[numeric.requirements]"/>.

        </p>
        <p>

I  believe  this  problem  was  introduced  by  the  adoption  of  the
resolution                outlined                in                <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/1996/N0857.asc">N0857</a>,
<i>Assignment  of  valarrays</i>,  from  1996.   The  copy  assignment
operator  of  the original  numerical  array  classes  proposed in  <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/1993/N0280.pdf">N0280</a>,
as      well       as      the      one       proposed      in      <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/1993/N0308.asc">N0308</a>
(both  from 1993), had  well-defined semantics  for arrays  of unequal
size (the  latter explicitly  only when <code>*this</code>  was empty;
assignment of non empty arrays of unequal size was a runtime error).

        </p>
        <p>

The  justification for  the  change given  in  N0857 was the "loss  of
performance [deemed]  only significant  for very simple  operations on
small arrays or for architectures with very few registers."

        </p>
        <p>

Since tiny  arrays on a  limited subset of hardware  architectures are
likely  to  be  an   exceedingly  rare  case  (despite  the  continued
popularity of  x86) I  propose to revert  the resolution and  make the
behavior    of   all   <code>valarray</code>    assignment   operators
well-defined even  for non-conformal  arrays (i.e., arrays  of unequal
size).   I have implemented  this change  and measured  no significant
degradation  in performance in  the common  case (non-empty  arrays of
equal size).  I  have measured a 50% (and in  some cases even greater)
speedup  in the  case of  assignments to  empty arrays  versus calling
<code>resize()</code>  first followed  by  an invocation  of the  copy
assignment operator.

<resolution>
        <p>

Change <sref ref="[valarray.assign]"/>, p1 as follows:

        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <code>

valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp; operator=(const valarray&lt;T&gt;&amp;<ins> x</ins>);

            </p>
            <p>

-1- Each element of the <code>*this</code> array is assigned the value
of  the  corresponding  element   of  the  argument  array.   <del>The
resulting behavior is undefined if </del><ins>When </ins>the length of
the  argument  array  is  not   equal  to  the  length  of  the  *this
array<del>.</del><ins>  resizes  <code>*this</code>  to make  the  two
arrays     the      same     length,     as      if     by     calling
<code>resize(x.size())</code>, before performing the assignment.</ins>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>

And  add a new  paragraph just  below paragraph  1 with  the following
text:

        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>

<ins>-2- <i>Postcondition</i>: <code>size() == x.size()</code>.</ins>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>

Also add the following paragraph to <sref ref="[valarray.assign]"/>, immediately after p4:

        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>

<ins>-?- When the length,  <i><code>N</code></i> of the array referred
to by the  argument is not equal to  the length of <code>*this</code>,
the  operator resizes <code>*this</code>  to make  the two  arrays the
same  length, as if  by calling  <code>resize(<i>N</i>)</code>, before
performing the assignment.</ins>

            </p>
        </blockquote>

<note>
pre-Sophia Antipolis, Martin adds the following compromise wording, but
prefers the original proposed resolution:
</note>

<!-- 
<p>
Change <sref ref="[valarray.assign]"/>, p1 as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 -1- <i>Requires:</i> <tt>size() == 0 || size() == x.size()</tt>.
</p>
<p>
 -2- <i>Effects:</i> If <tt>size() == 0</tt> calls <tt>x.resize(x.size())</tt> first.
     Each element of the <tt>*this</tt> array is assigned the value of the
     corresponding element of the argument array.
</p>
<p>
 -3- <i>Postcondition:</i> <tt>size() == x.size()</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Add the following paragraph to <sref ref="[valarray.assign]"/>, immediately after
p4:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 -?- When <tt>size() == 0</tt> and the length, <tt>N</tt> of the array referred to by
     the argument is not equal to the length of <tt>*this</tt>, the operator
     resizes <tt>*this</tt> to make the two arrays the same length, as if by
     calling <tt>resize(N)</tt>, before performing the assignment. Otherwise,
     when <tt>size() &gt; 0</tt> and <tt>size() != N</tt>, the behavior is undefined.
</p>

<note>
Kona (2007): Gaby to propose wording for an alternative resolution in
which you can assign to a <tt>valarray</tt> of size 0, but not to any other
<tt>valarray</tt> whose size is unequal to the right hand side of the assignment.
