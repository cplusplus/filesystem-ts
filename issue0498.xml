<title>Requirements for partition() and stable_partition() too strong</title>

Problem:
The iterator requirements for partition() and stable_partition() [25.2.12]
are listed as BidirectionalIterator, however, there are efficient algorithms
for these functions that only require ForwardIterator that have been known
since before the standard existed. The SGI implementation includes these (see
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/partition.html">http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/partition.html</a>
and
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stable_partition.html">http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stable_partition.html</a>).

[Editorial note: I looked for existing precedent in how we might call out
distinct overloads overloads from a set of constrained templates, but there
is not much existing practice to lean on.   advance/distance were the only
algorithms I could find, and that wording is no clearer.]

Hinnant: if you want to partition your std::forward_list, you'll need
partition() to accept ForwardIterators.

<rationale>
<p>
Partition is a "foundation" algorithm useful in many contexts (like sorting
as just one example) - my motivation for extending it to include forward
iterators is foward_list - without this extension you can't partition an foward_list
(without writing your own partition). Holes like this in the standard
library weaken the argument for generic programming (ideally I'd be able
to provide a library that would refine std::partition() to other concepts
without fear of conflicting with other libraries doing the same - but
that is a digression). I consider the fact that partition isn't defined
to work for ForwardIterator a minor embarrassment.
