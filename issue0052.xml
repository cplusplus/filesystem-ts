<title>[PDTS] Better to avoid deriving from <tt>std::iterator</tt></title>

<discussion>
<p>Although the Standard has made this mistake almost a dozen times, I recommend not
depicting <tt>directory_iterator</tt> and <tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> as deriving from
<tt>std::iterator</tt>, since that's a binding requirement on implementations.
Instead they should be depicted as having the appropriate typedefs, and leave it up to
implementers to decide how to provide them. (The difference is observable to users with
<tt>is_base_of</tt>, not that they should be asking that question.)</p>

<note>2014-02-08 Daniel comments and provides wording</note>
<p>
This issue is basically similar to the kind of solution that had been used to remove the
requirement to derive from <tt>unary_function</tt> and friends as described by
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3198.htm">N3198</a> and
I'm strongly in favour to follow that spirit here as well. I'd like to add that basically all
"newer" iterator types (such as the <tt>regex</tt> related iterator don't derive from
<tt>std::iterator</tt> either.
<p/>
Another reason to change the current specification is the fact that it currently says that
the member types <tt>pointer</tt> and <tt>reference</tt> would be determined to <tt>value_type*</tt>
and <tt>value_type&amp;</tt> (that is mutable pointers and references), which conflicts with the specification 
of the return types of the following members:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
const directory_entry&amp; operator*() const;
const directory_entry* operator-&gt;() const;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The proposed fording fixes this by correcting these <tt>typedef</tt> to corresponding <tt>const</tt> access.
<p/>
The very same objections had been expressed by issue <iref ref="51"/> and the below given wording resolves this
issue as well.
