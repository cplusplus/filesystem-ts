<p>
In San Francisco, June 2008, 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2722.pdf">N2722</a>
was adopted, replacing the variadic templates <tt>min</tt>, <tt>max</tt>, and
<tt>minmax</tt> by overloads that have an <tt>initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</tt>
parameter. The paper showed benchmark results wherein <tt>initializer_list</tt>
versions of <tt>min</tt> appeared to outperform the corresponding variadic
template. Unfortunately, in October 2009 a very serious error was detected in
the benchmark. (<a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=25210">c++std-lib-25210</a>).
In fact, an <tt>initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</tt> version of <tt>min</tt> often
appears to perform <i>worse</i> than the corresponding variadic template,
especially when <tt>T</tt> has an expensive copy constructor 
(<a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=25253">c++std-lib-25253</a>,
<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~nd/dekkerware/issues/n2772_fix">http://www.xs4all.nl/~nd/dekkerware/issues/n2772_fix</a>).
</p>
<p>
IMO, the biggest problem of the <tt>initializer_list</tt> overloads is that they
pass and return <tt>T</tt> objects <i>by value</i>. Which has the following
consequences:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
They require that <tt>T</tt> is <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>. IMO that is too much of a
constraint for a generic, general purpose function like
<tt>std::min&lt;T&gt;</tt>.
</li>
<li>
They potentially throw an exception, even if <tt>T</tt>'s less-than-operator
throws nothing. (And of course, less-than typically throws nothing.)
</li>
<li>
They are inconsistent with C++03 <tt>std::min</tt> and <tt>std::max</tt>.
Consider the subtle difference between <tt>const T&amp; c1 = min(a,b);</tt> and
<tt>const T&amp; c2 = min({a,b});</tt> 
(<a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=25265">c++std-lib-25265</a>)
</li>
<li>
They do not conveniently support use cases that need to have a reference to the
minimum or maximum object <i>itself</i>, rather than just a copy.
</li>
<li>
They potentially perform badly: possibly <i>O(n)</i>, when the arguments
themselves have a size of <i>n</i>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the future, this problem might be solvable by using an
<tt>initializer_list</tt> of <i>const references</i>, instead:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
const T&amp; min(initializer_list&lt;const T&amp;&gt;);
const T&amp; max(initializer_list&lt;const T&amp;&gt;);
pair&lt;const T&amp;, const T&amp;&gt; minmax(initializer_list&lt;const T&amp;&gt;);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
It is unlikely that C++0x will support <tt>initializer_list&lt;const T&amp;&gt;</tt>, 
but technically it seems possible to add such a language
feature after C++0x 
(<a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=core&amp;msg=15428">c++std-core-15428</a>).
</p>
<p>
Variadic templates of <tt>min</tt>, <tt>max</tt>, and <tt>minmax</tt>, as
proposed by 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2551.pdf">N2551</a>
(Sylvain Pion), do have some other advantages over <tt>initializer_list</tt>
overloads:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It is likely that those variadic templates can be declared <tt>constexpr</tt>,
now that 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n3006.html#991">
CWG issue #991</a> is in drafting status.
</li>
<li>
They provide complete compile-time protection against accidentally passing zero
arguments.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Unfortunately, the variadic templates of <tt>min</tt>, <tt>max</tt>, and
<tt>minmax</tt> may still need further improvement, before having them in the
Standard Library. Especially the optional <tt>Compare</tt> parameter appears to
be a concern. So for this moment I recommend to keep both versions out of C++0x,
and postpone further discussion until after C++0x.

<note>
2010 Pittsburgh:  Discussed and the LWG still prefers the initializer list
solution of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2772.pdf">N2772</a>.

<rationale><p>
We prefer the solution of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2772.pdf">N2772</a>
which will be reapplied.
</p></rationale>

<resolution>
<p>
Remove both variadic templates and <tt>initializer_list</tt> overloads of
<tt>min</tt>, <tt>max</tt>, and <tt>minmax</tt> from the synopsis in
<sref ref="[algorithms.general]"/> and from <sref ref="[alg.min.max]"/>.
