<p>
I propose that <tt>clear()</tt> be defined to be equivalent to
<tt>erase(begin(),end())</tt> except not using copy or move of elements.

<p>
and specifiying as post: <tt>size()==0</tt> might also not be appropriate
because forward-Lists provide no <tt>size()</tt>, this it should be:
post: <tt>empty()==true</tt>
</p>

<p>
in table 94 we define <tt>clear()</tt> as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
a.clear() void erase(begin(), end())
post: size() == 0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now <tt>erase</tt> requires assignment (<tt>MoveAssignable</tt>) which makes
sense if we have to move an element, but why should that be required from
<tt>clear()</tt> where all elements are destroyed?

<p>
First, I read the newly proposed spec for <tt>clear()</tt> that it does in
general <em>not</em> invalidate a previous past-the-end iterator value, but
<tt>deque</tt> says in <sref ref="[deque.modifiers]"/> for the semantics of
<tt>erase</tt> that erasures at the end will invalidate the past-the-end
iterator. With removal of a direct binding between <tt>clear()</tt> and
<tt>erase()</tt> there seem to be some fixes necessary. One way to fix that
would be to mention in Table 94 that this "may also invalidate the past-the-end
iterator" and then to mention for all specific containers where this does not
happen, the exception, [1] e.g. in <tt>std::vector</tt>. <tt>std::vector</tt>
has no own specification of <tt>clear()</tt> and one aspect of the closed issue
<iref ref="1102"/> was to realize just that (indirectly via <tt>erase</tt>). IMO
we should now add an extra specification for <tt>clear()</tt>. Btw.:
<tt>std::vector::erase</tt> reads to me that it would invalidate previous
past-the-end values (and that seems correct in general).
</p>
<p>
Before I will provide explicit wording, I would like to
discuss these points.
</p>

<p>
[1] <tt>std::list</tt> does fortunately specify that clear does not invalidate
the past-the-end iterator.

<rationale>
<p>
Solved as proposed by LWG <iref ref="704"/>.

</rationale>

<resolution>

<p>
Change <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/10:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified (see 23.2.4.1, 23.2.5.1, 23.3.2.3, and 23.3.6.4) all
container types defined in this Clause meet the following additional
requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
..
</li>

<li>
no <tt>erase()</tt>, <ins><tt>clear()</tt>,</ins> <tt>pop_back()</tt> or
<tt>pop_front()</tt> function throws an exception.
</li>

<li>
...
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Replace the following words from Table 94 &mdash; Sequence container
requirements (in addition to container) in <sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">

post: <tt><del>size() == 0</del> <ins>a.empty() == true</ins></tt>.  </td>

<p>
Add a new paragraph after <sref ref="[forwardlist.modifiers]"/>/23:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void clear();
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>
23 <i>Effects:</i> Erases all elements in the range <tt>[begin(),end())</tt>.

<p><ins>
<i>Remarks:</i> Does not invalidate past-the-end iterators.
