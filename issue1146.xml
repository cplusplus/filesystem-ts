<p>
The "lockfree" facilities do not tell the programmer enough.
</p>

<p>
There are 2 problems here.
First, at least on x86,
it's less important to me whether some integral types are lock free
than what is the largest type I can pass to atomic and have it be lock-free.
For example, if <tt>long long</tt>s are not lock-free,
<tt>ATOMIC_INTEGRAL_LOCK_FREE</tt> is probably 1,
but I'd still be interested in knowing whether longs are always lock-free.
Or if long longs at any address are lock-free,
I'd expect <tt>ATOMIC_INTEGRAL_LOCK_FREE</tt> to be 2,
but I may actually care whether I have access to
the <code>cmpxchg16b</code> instruction.
None of the support here helps with that question.
(There are really 2 related questions here:
what alignment requirements are there for lock-free access;
and what processor is the program actually running on,
as opposed to what it was compiled for?)
</p>

<p>
Second, having <tt>atomic_is_lock_free</tt> only apply to individual objects
is pretty useless
(except, as Lawrence Crowl points out,
for throwing an exception when an object is unexpectedly not lock-free).
I'm likely to want to use its result to decide what algorithm to use,
and that algorithm is probably going to allocate new memory
containing atomic objects and then try to act on them.
If I can't predict the lock-freedom of the new object
by checking the lock-freedom of an existing object,
I may discover after starting the algorithm that I can't continue.

<p>
To solve the first problem, I think 2 macros would help:
<tt>MAX_POSSIBLE_LOCK_FREE_SIZE</tt> and <tt>MAX_GUARANTEED_LOCK_FREE_SIZE</tt>,
which expand to the maximum value of <tt>sizeof(T)</tt> for which atomic may
(or will, respectively) use lock-free operations.
Lawrence points out that this
"relies heavily on implementations
using word-size compare-swap on sub-word-size types,
which in turn requires address modulation."
He expects that to be the end state anyway, so it doesn't bother him much.
</p>

<p>
To solve the second,
I think one could specify that equally aligned objects of the same type
will return the same value from <tt>atomic_is_lock_free()</tt>.
I don't know how to specify "equal alignment".
Lawrence suggests an additional function, <tt>atomic_is_always_lock_free()</tt>.

<p>
In the evolution discussion of N2925, "More Collected Issues with
Atomics," there is an action item with respect to
LWG <iref ref="1146"/>, US 88
</p>

<p>
This is stated in the paper as:
</p>
<p>
Relatedly, Mike Sperts will create an issue to propose adding a traits
mechanism to check the compile-time properties through a template
mechanism rather than macros
</p>

<p>
Here is my attempt to do this. I don't believe that a separate trait is
necessary for this, and that instead <tt>atomic_integral::is_lock_free</tt> can
be re-purposed with minimal work as follows.
</p>

Howard: Put Benjamin's wording in the proposed wording section.

<p>
Just a thought... wouldn't it be better to use a scoped enum instead of
plain integers? For example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
enum class is_lock_free
{
    never = 0, sometimes = 1, always = 2;
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
if compatibility with C is deemed important, we could use an unscoped
enum with suitably chosen names.  It would still be more descriptive
than 0, 1 and 2.
