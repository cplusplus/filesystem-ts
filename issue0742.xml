<title>Enabling <tt>swap</tt> for proxy iterators</title>
<section><sref ref="[utility.arg.requirements]"/></section>

<p>
This issue was split from <iref ref="672"/>. <iref ref="672"/> now just
deals with changing the requirements of <tt>T</tt> in the <tt>Swappable</tt>
requirement from <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> and <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> to
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>.
</p>

<p>
This issue seeks to widen the <tt>Swappable</tt> requirement to support proxy iterators.  Here
is example code:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
namespace Mine {

template &lt;class T&gt;
struct proxy {...};

template &lt;class T&gt;
struct proxied_iterator
{
   typedef T value_type;
   typedef proxy&lt;T&gt; reference;
   reference operator*() const;
   ...
};

struct A
{
   // heavy type, has an optimized swap, maybe isn't even copyable or movable, just swappable
   void swap(A&amp;);
   ...
};

void swap(A&amp;, A&amp;);
void swap(proxy&lt;A&gt;, A&amp;);
void swap(A&amp;, proxy&lt;A&gt;);
void swap(proxy&lt;A&gt;, proxy&lt;A&gt;);

}  // Mine

...

Mine::proxied_iterator&lt;Mine::A&gt; i(...)
Mine::A a;
<b>swap(*i1, a);</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The key point to note in the above code is that in the call to <tt>swap</tt>, <tt>*i1</tt>
and <tt>a</tt> are different types (currently types can only be <tt>Swappable</tt> with the
same type).  A secondary point is that to support proxies, one must be able to pass rvalues
to <tt>swap</tt>.  But note that I am not stating that the general purpose <tt>std::swap</tt>
should accept rvalues!  Only that overloaded <tt>swap</tt>s, as in the example above, be allowed
to take rvalues.
</p>

<p>
That is, no standard library code needs to change.  We simply need to have a more flexible
definition of <tt>Swappable</tt>.

<p>
While we believe Concepts work will define a swappable concept, we
should still resolve this issue if possible to give guidance to the
Concepts work.
</p>
<p>
Would an ambiguous swap function in two namespaces found by ADL break
this wording? Suggest that the phrase "valid expression" means such a
pair of types would still not be swappable.
</p>
<p>
Motivation is proxy-iterators, but facility is considerably more
general. Are we happy going so far?
</p>
<p>
We think this wording is probably correct and probably an improvement on
what's there in the WP. On the other hand, what's already there in the
WP is awfully complicated. Why do we need the two bullet points? They're
too implementation-centric. They don't add anything to the semantics of
what swap() means, which is there in the post-condition. What's wrong
with saying that types are swappable if you can call swap() and it
satisfies the semantics of swapping?

Updated wording to sync with

Also this issue is very closely related to <iref ref="594"/>.
