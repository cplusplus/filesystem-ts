<title>Do unordered containers not support function pointers for predicate&#47;hasher?</title>

<p>
Good ol' associative containers allow both function pointers and
function objects as feasible comparators, as described in 
<sref ref="[associative.reqmts]"/>&#47;2:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Each associative container is parameterized on <tt>Key</tt> and an ordering
relation <tt>Compare</tt> that induces a strict weak ordering (25.3) on 
elements of Key. [..]. The object of type <tt>Compare</tt> is called the 
comparison object of a container. This comparison object may be a pointer to
function or an object of a type with an appropriate function call operator.[..]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The corresponding wording for unordered containers is not so clear,
but I read it to disallow function pointers for the hasher and I miss 
a clear statement for the equality predicate, see
<sref ref="[unord.req]"/>&#47;3+4+5:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Each unordered associative container is parameterized by <tt>Key</tt>, by a
function object <tt>Hash</tt> that
acts as a hash function for values of type <tt>Key</tt>, and by a binary
predicate <tt>Pred</tt> that induces an
equivalence relation on values of type <tt>Key</tt>.[..]
</p>
<p>
A hash function is a function object that takes a single argument of
type <tt>Key</tt> and returns a value of type <tt>std::size_t</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Two values <tt>k1</tt> and <tt>k2</tt> of type <tt>Key</tt> are considered 
equal if the container's equality function object returns <tt>true</tt> 
when passed those values.[..]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and table 97 says in the column "assertion...post-condition" for the
expression <tt>X::hasher</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<tt>Hash</tt> shall be a unary function object type such that the expression
<tt>hf(k)</tt> has type <tt>std::size_t</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Note that <sref ref="[function.objects]"/>&#47;1 defines as "Function objects are
objects with an <tt>operator()</tt> defined.[..]"
</p>
<p>
Does this restriction exist by design or is it an oversight? If an
oversight, I suggest that to apply
the following

<blockquote><p>
Ask Daniel to provide proposed wording that: makes it explicit that
function pointers are function objects at the beginning of 
<sref ref="[function.objects]"/>; fixes the "requirements" for typedefs in
<sref ref="[refwrap]"/> to instead state that the function objects
defined in that clause have these typedefs, but not that these typedefs
are requirements on function objects; remove the wording that explicitly
calls out that associative container comparators may be function
pointers.

<rationale>

<p>
The below provided wording also affects some part of the library which is
involved with <em>callable types</em> (<sref ref="[func.def]"/>&#47;3). Reason for
this is that <em>callable objects</em> do have a lot in common with <em>function
objects</em>. A simple formula seems to be:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
callable objects = function objects + pointers to member
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The latter group is excluded from function objects because of the
expression-based usage of <em>function objects</em> in the algorithm clause,
which is incompatible with the notation to dereference pointers to member
without a concept map available in the language.
</p>

<p>
This analysis showed some currently existing normative definition differences
between the above subset of callable objects and function objects which seem to
be unintended: Backed by the Santa Cruz outcome function objects should include
both function pointers and "object[s] with an operator() defined". This clearly
excludes class types with a conversion function to a function pointer or all
similar conversion function situations described in <sref ref="[over.match]"/>&#47;2
b. 2. In contrast to this, the wording for callable types seems to be less
constrained (<sref ref="[func.def]"/>/3):
</p>

<blockquote><p>
A callable type is a [..] class type whose objects can appear immediately to the
left of a function call operator.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The rationale given in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1673.html#fn2">N1673</a>
and a recent private communication with Peter Dimov revealed that the intention
of this wording was to cover the above mentioned class types with conversion
functions as well. To me the current wording of callable types can be read
either way and I suggest to make the intention more explicit by replacing
</p>

<blockquote><p>
[..] class type whose objects can appear immediately to the left of a function
call operator
</p></blockquote>
<p>
by
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[..] class type whose objects can appear as the leftmost subexpression of a
function call expression <sref ref="[expr.call]"/>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
and to use the same definition for the class type part of <em>function
objects</em>, because there is no reason to exclude class types with a
conversion function to e.g. pointer to function from being used in algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Now this last term "function objects" itself brings us to a third unsatisfactory
state: The term is used both for objects (e.g. "Function objects are
objects[..]" in <sref ref="[function.objects]"/>&#47;1) and for types (e.g. "Each
unordered associative container is parameterized [..] by a function object Hash
that acts as a hash function [..]" in <sref ref="[unord.req]"/>&#47;3). This
impreciseness should be fixed and I suggest to introduce the term <em>function
object type</em> as the counter part to <em>callable type</em>. This word seems
to be a quite natural choice, because the library already uses it here and there
(e.g. "Hash shall be a unary function object type such that the expression
<tt>hf(k)</tt> has type <tt>std::size_t</tt>." in Table 98, "<tt>X::hasher</tt>"
or "Requires: <tt>T</tt> shall be a function object type [..]" in 
<sref ref="[func.wrap.func.targ]"/>&#47;3).
</p>

<p>
Finally I would like to add that part of the issue 870 discussion related to the
requirements for typedefs in <sref ref="[refwrap]"/> during the Santa Cruz
meeting is now handled by the new issue <iref ref="1290"/>.
