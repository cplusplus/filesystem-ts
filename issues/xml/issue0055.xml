  <p>
    The proposed change below was suggested in Issaquah as part of the resolution of issue 13 to clarify
    the Error reporting section. LWG/SG3 liked the change, but since issue 13 was NAD requested that a separate
    issue be opened.

  <note>2014-02-13 LWG/SG-3 Issaquah: Proposed wording accepted.</note>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Functions <b>not</b> having an argument of type <code>error_code&amp;</code> report errors as follows, unless otherwise specified:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a call by the
            implementation to an operating system or other underlying API results in an
            error that prevents the function from meeting its specifications, an exception
            of type
            <code>filesystem_error</code> shall be thrown. For functions with a single path
            argument, that argument shall be passed to the
            <code>filesystem_error</code> constructor with a single path argument.&nbsp; For
            functions with two path arguments, the first of these arguments shall be
            passed to the
            <code>filesystem_error</code> constructor as the <code>path1</code> argument,
            and the second shall be passed as the <code>path2</code> argument.
            <ins>
              The <code>filesystem_error</code> constructor's <code>error_code</code> argument is set as
              appropriate for the specific operating system dependent error.
            </ins><br/>
            &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Failure to allocate storage is reported by throwing an exception as described in C++11
            &sect; 17.6.4.10.<br/>
            &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>Destructors throw nothing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Functions having an argument of type <code>error_code&amp;</code> report errors as follows, unless otherwise
          specified:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If a call by the
            implementation to an operating system or other underlying API results in an
            error that prevents the function from meeting its specifications, the
            <code>error_code&amp;</code> argument is set as
            appropriate for the specific <ins>operating system dependent</ins> error.
            Otherwise, <code>clear()</code> is called on the <code>error_code&amp;</code> argument.
          </li>
        </ul>
