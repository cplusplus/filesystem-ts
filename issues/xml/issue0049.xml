<p>
<tt>path</tt>'s move ctor is marked <tt>noexcept</tt>, but it contains a <tt>basic_string</tt>.
Similarly, <tt>directory_entry</tt>'s move ctor is marked <tt>noexcept</tt>, but it contains a <tt>path</tt>.
This is affected by LWG 2319 "<tt>basic_string</tt>'s move constructor should not be <tt>noexcept</tt>".

<a href="sg3-active.html#38">38</a>,
<a href="sg3-active.html#41">41</a>,
and <a href="sg3-active.html#49">49</a> are concerned with signatures which should or should not
be <tt>noexcept</tt>. I will provide unified proposed wording for these issues, possibly in a separate paper.
