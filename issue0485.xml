<p>
The note on 24.1.2 Output iterators insufficiently limits what can be
performed on output iterators. While it requires that each iterator is
progressed through only once and that each iterator is written to only
once, it does not require the following things:</p>

<p>Note: Here it is assumed that <tt>x</tt> is an output iterator of type <tt>X</tt> which
has not yet been assigned to.</p>

<p>a) That each value of the output iterator is written to:
The standard allows:
<tt>++x; ++x; ++x;</tt>
</p>

<p>
b) That assignments to the output iterator are made in order
<tt>X a(x); ++a; *a=1; *x=2;</tt> is allowed
</p>

<p>
c) Chains of output iterators cannot be constructed:
<tt>X a(x); ++a; X b(a); ++b; X c(b); ++c;</tt> is allowed, and under the current
wording (I believe) <tt>x,a,b,c</tt> could be written to in any order.
</p>

<p>I do not believe this was the intension of the standard?</p>
<note>Lillehammer: Real issue.  There are lots of constraints we
  intended but didn't specify.  Should be solved as part of iterator
  redesign.</note>
