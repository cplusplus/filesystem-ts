<p><b>Addresses US 78</b></p>

<p>
There is presently no way to convert directly from a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> to a
<tt>unique_ptr</tt>. Add an interface that performs the conversion.

<blockquote><p>
We look forward to a paper on this topic. We recommend no action until a
paper is available. We believe that the shared pointer must use the default
deleter for the conversion to succeed.

<blockquote><p>
This is basically a request for <tt>shared_ptr&lt;&gt;::release</tt> in
disguise, with all the associated problems. Not a good idea.

<blockquote>
<p>
The rationale for the omission of a release() member function from shared_ptr is given in:
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_39_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_39_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
The implementation of such a member is non-trivial (and maybe
impossible), because it would need to account for the deleter.

<p>
I took an online poll and got 3 votes for NAD and 3 for NAD Future.  Personally
I prefer NAD Future as this does refer to an extension that could conceivably be
considered beyond C++0X.
</p>

<p>
However such an extension would need to solve a couple of problems:
</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the interface for such a conversion when the <tt>shared_ptr</tt> does
not have unique ownership?  Throw an exception?  Create a null <tt>unique_ptr</tt>?
Undefined behavior?
</li>

<li>
<p>
How does one handle custom deleters given to the <tt>shared_ptr</tt> constructor?
</p>
<p>
I do not believe it is possible to implement a general answer to this question.
The <tt>shared_ptr</tt> deleter is a run time (or construction time) characteristic.
The <tt>unique_ptr</tt> deleter is a compile time characteristic.  In general one
can not know to what type of <tt>unqiue_ptr</tt> you are converting to.
</p>
<p>
One answer is for the user of the conversion to specify the deleter type and perhaps
throw an exception if the specification turns out to be incorrect.
</p>
<p>
Another answer is for the conversion to only be valid when the underlying deleter
is <tt>default_delete</tt>.  We would probalby need to specify that this is indeed the
underlying deleter of a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> when a custom deleter is not given in
the constructor.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
At any rate, there are non-trivial design issues which would need to be implemented
and tested in the field for usability prior to standardization.
