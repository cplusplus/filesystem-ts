<p>
According to Table 96 (Container requirements) the return type of <tt>X::reference</tt> and
<tt>X::const_reference</tt> is "lvalue of <tt>T</tt>" and "<tt>const</tt> lvalue of <tt>T</tt>",
respectively. This does not make much sense, because an lvalue is an expression category, not a type.
It could also refer to an expression that has a type, but this doesn't make sense either in this
context, because obviously <tt>X::[const_]reference</tt> are intended to refer to types. 
<p/>
Given the fact that <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> has no real reference type for <tt>X::[const_]reference</tt> 
and this definition presumably is intended to cover such situations as well, one might think that the wording is
just a sloppy form of "type that represents a [const] lvalue of T". But this is also problematic,
because basically all proxy reference expressions are rvalues.
<p/>
It is unclear what the intention is. A straightward way of fixing this wording could make
<tt>X::[const_]reference</tt> identical to <tt>[const] T&amp;</tt>. This holds for all Library containers
except for <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
Another way of solving this definition problem would be to impose a requirement that holds for both
references and reference-like proxies. Both <tt>X::reference</tt> and <tt>X::const_reference</tt>
would need to be convertible to <tt>const T&amp;</tt>. Additionally <tt>X::reference</tt> would need to
support for a mutable container an assignment expression of the form 
<tt>declval&lt;X::reference&gt;() = declval&lt;T&gt;()</tt> (this presentation intentionally does not require 
<tt>declval&lt;X::reference<span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">&amp;</span>&gt;() = declval&lt;T&gt;()</tt>).
<p/>
Further, the Table 96 does not impose any relations between <tt>X::reference</tt> and <tt>X::const_reference</tt>.
It seems that at least <tt>X::reference</tt> needs to be convertible to <tt>X::const_reference</tt>.
<p/>
A related question is whether <tt>X::reference</tt> is supposed to be a mutable reference-like type,
irrespective of whether the container is an immutable container or not. The way, type <tt>match_results</tt>
defines <tt>reference</tt> identical to <tt>const_reference</tt> indicates one specific interpretation (similarly,
the <tt>initializer_list</tt> template also defines member type <tt>reference</tt> equal to <tt>const value_type&amp;</tt>).
Note that this can be a different decision as that for <tt>iterator</tt> and <tt>const_iterator</tt>,
e.g. for sets the type <tt>X::reference</tt> still is a mutable reference, even though <tt>iterator</tt>
is described as constant iterator.
<p/>
The proposed resolution is incomplete in regard to the last question.
