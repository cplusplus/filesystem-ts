<title>Strong guarantee on <tt>vector::push_back()</tt> still broken with C++11?</title>

<p>
According to my understanding, the strong guarantee of <tt>push_back()</tt> led to the introduction of <tt>noexcept</tt> 
and to the typical implementation that vectors usually copy their elements on reallocation unless the move operations of 
their element type guarantees not to throw.
<p/>
However, if I read the standard correctly, we still don't give the strong guarantee any more:
Yes, <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/10 specifies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified (see 23.2.4.1, 23.2.5.1, 23.3.3.4, and 23.3.6.5) all container types defined in this
Clause meet the following additional requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>[&hellip;]</li>
<li>if an exception is thrown by a <tt>push_back()</tt> or <tt>push_front()</tt> function, that function has no effects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, <sref ref="[vector.modifiers]"/> specifies for vector modifiers, <em>including</em> <tt>push_back()</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator, or move 
assignment operator of <tt>T</tt> or by any <tt>InputIterator</tt> operation there are no effects. If an exception 
is thrown by the move constructor of a non-<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> <tt>T</tt>, the effects are unspecified.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I would interpret this as an "otherwise specified" behavior for <tt>push_back()</tt>, saying that the strong guarantee 
is only given if constructors and assignments do not throw. 
<p/>
That means, the strong guarantee of C++03 is broken with C++11.
<p/>
In addition to all that <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> p10 b2 doesn't mention the corresponding functions
<tt>emplace_back()</tt> and <tt>emplace_front()</tt>. These are similar single-element additions and should provide the same
strong guarantee.
<p/>
Daniel adds:
<p/>
It seems the error came in when <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2350.pdf">N2350</a>
and <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2345.pdf">N2345</a> became accepted and where 
integrated into the working draft <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2369.pdf">N2369</a>.
The merge resulted in a form that changed the previous meaning and as far as I understand it, this effect was not intended.

<note>2013-09-26, Nico improves wording</note>

<p>
The new proposed resolution is driven as follows:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> <p>In the container requirements section, there shall be general statements that single element insertions
      and <tt>push_back()</tt>, <tt>pop_back</tt>, <tt>emplace_front()</tt>, and <tt>emplace_back()</tt> have no effect
      on any exception.
      <p/>
      That is: we extend the first two statements by adding <tt>emplace_front()</tt> and <tt>emplace_back()</tt>, which
      are missing.
	  </p>
</li>
 <li> <p>Formulate only the exceptions from that (or where other general statements might
      lead to the impression, that the blanket statement no longer applies):</p>
      <ul>
       <li> <p>remove the statement in <tt>list::push_back()</tt> saying again that exceptions have to effect.</p></li>
       <li> <p>Clarify that all single-element insertions at either end of a <tt>deque</tt> have the strong guarantee.</p> </li>
       <li> <p>Clarify that all single-element insertions at the end of a <tt>vector</tt> have the strong guarantee.</p></li>
      </ul> 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
-1- <i>Effects:</i> An insertion in the middle of the deque invalidates all the iterators and references to elements
of the deque. An insertion at either end of the deque invalidates all the iterators to the deque, but has
no effect on the validity of references to elements of the deque.
</p><p>
-2- <i>Remarks:</i> 
If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment
operator, or move assignment operator of <tt>T</tt> there are no effects.

If an exception is thrown while inserting a single element at either end, there are no effects.

constructor of a non-<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> <tt>T</tt>, the effects are unspecified.
</p><p>
-3- <i>Complexity:</i> The complexity is linear in the number of elements inserted plus the lesser of the distances
to the beginning and end of the deque. Inserting a single element either at the beginning or end of a
deque always takes constant time and causes a single call to a constructor of <tt>T</tt>.
