<p>
There is no way to join a thread with a timeout.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<blockquote><p>
Add <tt>join_for</tt> and <tt>join_until</tt>. Or decide one should
never join a thread with a timeout since <tt>pthread_join</tt> doesn't have a 
timeout version.
</p></blockquote>

The concurrency working group deemed this an extension beyond the scope of C++0x.

<rationale><p>The LWG does not wish to make a change at this time.</p></rationale>
