<p>
Shouldn't <tt>move_iterator</tt> be specialized so that if the iterator it wraps
returns a prvalue when dereferenced, the <tt>move_iterator</tt> also returns by
value? Otherwise, it creates a dangling reference.
<p/>
Howard: I believe just changing <tt>move_iterator&lt;I&gt;::reference</tt> would do.
A direction might be testing on <tt>is_reference&lt;iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::reference&gt;</tt>, 
or <tt>is_reference&lt;decltype(*declval&lt;I&gt;())&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
Daniel: I would prefer to use a consistent style among the iterator adaptors, so I
suggest to keep with the <tt>iterator_traits</tt> typedefs if possible. 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using reference = typename conditional&lt;
  is_reference&lt;typename iterator_traits&lt;Iterator&gt;::reference&gt;::value,
  value_type&amp;&amp;,
  value_type
&gt;::type;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
We might also want to ensure that if <tt>Iterator</tt>'s <tt>reference</tt> type <em>is</em>
a reference, the referent is equal to <tt>value_type</tt> (after removal of <i>cv</i>-qualifiers). 
In <em>general</em> we have no such guarantee.
<p/>
Marc: In the default case where we don't return <tt>value_type&amp;&amp;</tt>, should we use 
<tt>value_type</tt> or should we keep the <tt>reference</tt> type of the wrapped iterator?
<p/>
Daniel: This suggestion looks appealing at first, but the problem here is that using this typedef
can make it impossible for <tt>move_iterator</tt> to satisfy its contract, which means returning
an rvalue of the value type (Currently it says rvalue-reference, but this must be fixed as of
this issue anyway). I think that user-code can reasonably expect that when it has constructed
an object <tt>m</tt> of <tt>move_iterator&lt;It&gt;</tt>, where <tt>It</tt> is a valid 
mutable iterator type, the expression
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">It::value_type&amp;&amp; rv = *m;</span>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is well-formed.
<p/>
Let's set <tt>R</tt> equal to <tt>iterator_traits&lt;Iterator&gt;::reference</tt>
in the following. We can discuss the following situations:
</p>
<ol><li><tt>R</tt> is a reference type: We can only return the corresponding xvalue of <tt>R</tt>,
if <tt>value_type</tt> is reference-related to the referent type, else this is presumably no
forward iterator and we cannot say much about it, except that it must be convertible to
<tt>value_type</tt>, so it better should return a prvalue.</li>
<li><tt>R</tt> is not a reference type: In this case we can rely on a conversion to
<tt>value_type</tt> again, but not much more. Assume we would return <tt>R</tt> directly,
this might turn out to have a conversion to an lvalue-reference type of the value type (for
example). If that is the case, this would indirectly violate the contract of 
<tt>move_iterator</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In regard to the first scenario I suggest that implementations are simply required to
check that <tt>V2 = remove_cv&lt;remove_reference&lt;R&gt;::type&gt;::type</tt> is equal
to the value type <tt>V1</tt> as a criterion to return this reference as an xvalue, in all other
cases it should return the value type directly as prvalue.
<p/>
The additional advantage of this strategy is, that we always ensure that <tt>reference</tt> has 
the correct <i>cv</i>-qualification, if <tt>R</tt> is a real reference.
<p/>
It is possible to improve this a bit by indeed supporting reference-related types,
this would require to test <tt>is_same&lt;V1, V2&gt;::value || is_base_of&lt;V1, V2&gt;::value</tt> 
instead. I'm unsure whether (a) this additional effort is worth it and (b) a strict reading of
the forward iterator requirements seems not to allow to return a reference-related type (Whether 
this is a defect or not is another question).
</p>

<note>2011-12-05: Marc Glisse comments and splits into two resolution alternatives</note>

<p>
I guess I am looking at the speed of:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
value_type x;
x = *m;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
(copy construction would likely trigger copy elision and thus be neutral)

instead of the validity of:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
value_type&amp;&amp; x = *m;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In this sense, Daniels earlier proposition that ignored <tt>value_type</tt> and just did 
switch_lvalue_ref_to_rvalue_ref&lt;reference&gt; was easier to understand (and it didn't 
require thinking about reference related types).
<p/>
The currently proposed resolution has been split into two alternatives.

<note>2012, Kona</note>
<p>
Move to Review.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: This only applies to input iterators, so keep that in mind when thinking about this.
</p>
<p>
STL: I see what B is doing, but not A.
</p>
<p>
Howard: I agree.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: Should we use <tt>add_rvalue_reference</tt>?
</p>
<p>
STL: No, we do not want reference collapsing.
</p>
<p>
STL: Re A, messing with the CV qualification scares me.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: Agree. That would break my intent.
</p>
<p>
STL: Actually I don't think it's actually wrong, but I still don't see what it's doing.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: A is picking the value type, B is picking the proxy type.
</p>
<p>
Howard: I like returning the proxy type.
</p>
<p>
STL: Returning a reference (B) seems right, because the requirements say "reference".
I suspect that B works correctly if you have a move iterator wrapping a move iterator
wrapping a thing.  I think that A would mess up the type in the middle.
</p>
<p>
Considerable discussion about which version is correct, checking various examples.
</p>
<p>
STL: Still think B is right. Still don't understand A. In A we are losing the proxyness.
</p>
<p>
Howard: Agree 100%. We don't want to lose the proxy. If it's const, so be it.
</p>
<p>
STL: B is also understandable by mortals.
</p>
<p>
Howard: Remove to review, keep A but move it out of the proposed resolution area
(but keep it for rational).
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: Adding an explanatory note might be a good idea, if someone wants to write one.
</p>
<p>
Walter: Concerned about losing the word "reference" in p.1.
</p>
<p>
Howard: <tt>move_iterator</tt> will return an xvalue or a prvalue, both of which are rvalues.
</p>

<note>2012, Portland: Move to Tentatively Ready</note>
<p>
AJM wonders if the implied trait might be useful elsewhere, and worth adding to type traits as a
transformation type trait.
</p>

<p>
Suspicion that the Range SG might find such a trait useful, but wait until there is clear additional
use of such a trait before standardizing.
</p>

<p>
Minor wording tweak to use <tt>add_rvalue_reference</tt> rather than manually adding the <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>,
then move to Tentatively Ready.
</p>

<note>2013-01-09 Howard Hinnat comments</note>

<p>
I believe the P/R for LWG 2106 is incorrect (item 3).  The way it currently reads, <tt>move_iterator&lt;I&gt;::reference</tt> 
is <em>always</em> an lvalue reference.  I.e. if <tt>R</tt> is an lvalue reference type, then reference becomes 
<tt>add_rvalue_reference&lt;R&gt;::type</tt> which is just <tt>R</tt>. And if <tt>R</tt> is not a reference type, 
then reference becomes <tt>R</tt> (which is also just <tt>R</tt> ;-)).
</p>

<p>
I believe the correct wording is what was there previously:
</p>

<p>
-?- Let <tt>R</tt> be <tt>iterator_traits&lt;Iterator&gt;::reference</tt>. If <tt>is_reference&lt;R&gt;::value</tt> 
is true, the template instantiation <tt>move_iterator&lt;Iterator&gt;</tt> shall define the nested type named 
<tt>reference</tt> as a synonym for <tt>remove_reference&lt;R&gt;::type&amp;&amp;</tt>, otherwise as a synonym for 
<tt>R</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally Marc Glisse points out that <tt>move_iterator&lt;I&gt;::operator*()</tt> should return 
<tt>static_cast&lt;reference&gt;(*current)</tt>, not <tt>std::move(*current)</tt>.
