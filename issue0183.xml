<title>I/O stream manipulators don't work for wide character streams</title>
<section><sref ref="[std.manip]"/></section>
<submitter>Andy Sawyer</submitter>
<date>7 Jul 1999</date>

<discussion>
<p><sref ref="[std.manip]"/> paragraph 3 says (clause numbering added for
exposition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns: An object s of unspecified type such that if [1] out is an (instance
of) basic_ostream then the expression out&lt;&lt;s behaves as if f(s) were
called, and if [2] in is an (instance of) basic_istream then the expression
in&gt;&gt;s behaves as if f(s) were called. Where f can be defined as: ios_base&amp;
f(ios_base&amp; str, ios_base::fmtflags mask) { // reset specified flags
str.setf(ios_base::fmtflags(0), mask); return str; } [3] The expression
out&lt;&lt;s has type ostream&amp; and value out. [4] The expression in&gt;&gt;s
has type istream&amp; and value in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the definitions [1] and [2] for out and in, surely [3] should read:
&quot;The expression out &lt;&lt; s has type basic_ostream&amp; ...&quot; and
[4] should read: &quot;The expression in &gt;&gt; s has type basic_istream&amp;
...&quot;</p>
<p>If the wording in the standard is correct, I can see no way of implementing
any of the manipulators so that they will work with wide character streams.</p>
<p>e.g. wcout &lt;&lt; setbase( 16 );</p>
<p>Must have value 'wcout' (which makes sense) and type 'ostream&amp;' (which
doesn't).</p>
<p>The same &quot;cut'n'paste&quot; type also seems to occur in Paras 4,5,7 and
8. In addition, Para 6 [setfill] has a similar error, but relates only to
ostreams.</p>
<p>I'd be happier if there was a better way of saying this, to make it clear
that the value of the expression is &quot;the same specialization of
basic_ostream as out&quot;&amp;</p>

<note>Tokyo - The LWG noted that issue <iref ref="216"/> involves

<note>Post-Tokyo: The issues list maintainer combined the proposed
resolution of this issue with the proposed resolution for issue <iref
ref="216"/> as they both involved the same paragraphs, and were so
intertwined that dealing with them separately appear fraught with
error.  The full text was supplied by Bill Plauger; it was cross
checked against changes supplied by Andy Sawyer. It should be further
