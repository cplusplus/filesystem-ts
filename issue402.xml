<title>wrong new expression in [some_]allocator::construct</title>

<p>
This applies to the new expression that is contained in both par12 of
<sref ref="[allocator.members]"/> and in par2 (table 32) of <sref ref="[default.con.req]"/>.
I think this new expression is wrong, involving unintended side
effects.
</p>


<p><sref ref="[allocator.members]"/>  contains the following 3 lines:</p>

<pre>
  11 Returns: the largest value N for which the call allocate(N,0) might succeed.
     void construct(pointer p, const_reference val);
  12 Returns: new((void *) p) T( val)
</pre>


<p><sref ref="[default.con.req]"/> in table 32 has the following line:</p>
<pre>
  a.construct(p,t)   Effect: new((void*)p) T(t)
</pre>

<p>
.... with the prerequisits coming from the preceding two paragraphs,
especially from table 31:
</p>

<pre>
  alloc&lt;T&gt;             a     ;// an allocator for T
  alloc&lt;T&gt;::pointer    p     ;// random access iterator
                              // (may be different from T*)
  alloc&lt;T&gt;::reference  r = *p;// T&amp;
  T const&amp;             t     ;
</pre>

<p>
Cause of using "new" but not "::new", any existing "T::operator new"
function will hide the global placement new function. When there is no
"T::operator new" with adequate signature,
every_alloc&lt;T&gt;::construct(..) is ill-formed, and most
std::container&lt;T,every_alloc&lt;T&gt;&gt; use it; a workaround
would be adding placement new and delete functions with adequate
signature and semantic to class T, but class T might come from another
party. Maybe even worse is the case when T has placement new and
delete functions with adequate signature but with "unknown" semantic:
I dont like to speculate about it, but whoever implements
any_container&lt;T,any_alloc&gt; and wants to use construct(..)
probably must think about it.

<resolution>
<p>
Replace "new" with "::new" in both cases.
