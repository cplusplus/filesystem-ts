This issue was split off from <iref ref="892"/> at the request of the LWG.

<p>
This issue is more complicated than it looks.
</p>
<p>
paragraph 47: replace each <tt>(first, last) with (first, last]</tt>
</p>
<p>
add a statement after paragraph 48 that complexity is O(1)
</p>
<p>
remove the complexity statement from the first overload of splice_after
</p>
<p>
We may have the same problems with other modifiers, like erase_after.
Should it require that all iterators in the range (position, last] be
dereferenceable?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are actually 3 issues here:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
What value should <tt>erase_after</tt> return?  With <tt>list</tt>, code often
looks like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
for (auto i = l.begin(); i != l.end();)
{
    // inspect *i and decide if you want to erase it
    // ...
    if (I want to erase *i)
        i = l.erase(i);
    else
        ++i;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I.e. the iterator returned from <tt>erase</tt> is useful for setting up the
logic for operating on the next element.  For <tt>forward_list</tt> this might
look something like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto i = fl.before_begin();
auto ip1 = i;
for (++ip1; ip1 != fl.end(); ++ip1)
{
    // inspect *(i+1) and decide if you want to erase it
    // ...
    if (I want to erase *(i+1))
        i = fl.erase_after(i);
    else
        ++i;
    ip1 = i;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In the above example code, it is convenient if <tt>erase_after</tt> returns
the element <i>prior</i> to the erased element (range) instead of the element
<i>after</i> the erase element (range).
</p>
<p>
Existing practice:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SGI slist returns an iterator referencing the element <i>after</i> the erased range.</li>
<li>CodeWarrior slist returns an iterator referencing the element <i>before</i> the erased range.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is not a strong technical argument for either solution over the other.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
With all other containers, operations always work on the range
<tt>[first, last)</tt> and/or <i>prior to</i> the given <tt>position</tt>.
</p>
<p>
With <tt>forward_list</tt>, operations sometimes work on the range
<tt>(first, last]</tt> and/or <i>after</i> the given <tt>position</tt>.
</p>
<p>
This is simply due to the fact that in order to operate on
<tt>*first</tt> (with <tt>forward_list</tt>) one needs access to
<tt>*(first-1)</tt>.  And that's not practical with
<tt>forward_list</tt>.  So the operating range needs to start with <tt>(first</tt>,
not <tt>[first</tt> (as the current working paper says). 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, if one is interested in  splicing the range <tt>(first, last)</tt>,
then (with <tt>forward_list</tt>), one needs practical (constant time) access to
<tt>*(last-1)</tt> so that one can set the <i>next</i> field in this node to
the proper value.  As this is not possible with <tt>forward_list</tt>, one must
specify the last element of interest instead of one past the last element of
interest.  The syntax for doing this is to pass <tt>(first, last]</tt> instead
of <tt>(first, last)</tt>.
</p>
<p>
With <tt>erase_after</tt> we have a choice of either erasing the range
<tt>(first, last]</tt> <em>or</em> <tt>(first, last)</tt>.  Choosing the latter
enables:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
x.erase_after(pos, x.end());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
With the former, the above statement is inconvenient or expensive due to the lack
of constant time access to <tt>x.end()-1</tt>.  However we could introduce:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
iterator erase_to_end(const_iterator position);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
to compensate.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of the former (<tt>(first, last]</tt>) for <tt>erase_after</tt>
is a consistency with <tt>splice_after</tt> which uses <tt>(first, last]</tt>
as the specified range.  But this either requires the addition of <tt>erase_to_end</tt>
or giving up such functionality.
</p>

</li>

<li>
As stated in the discussion of <iref ref="892"/>, and reienforced by point 2 above,
a <tt>splice_after</tt> should work on the source range <tt>(first, last]</tt>
if the operation is to be <i>&#927;</i>(1).  When splicing an entire list <tt>x</tt> the
algorithm needs <tt>(x.before_begin(), x.end()-1]</tt>.  Unfortunately <tt>x.end()-1</tt>
is not available in constant time unless we specify that it must be.  In order to
make <tt>x.end()-1</tt> available in constant time, the implementation would have
to dedicate a pointer to it.  I believe the design of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2543.htm">N2543</a>
intended a nominal overhead of <tt>foward_list</tt> of 1 pointer.  Thus splicing
one <i>entire</i> <tt>forward_list</tt> into another can not be <i>&#927;</i>(1).

<p>
We may need a new issue to correct splice_after, because it may no
longer be correct to accept an rvalues as an argument. Merge may be
affected, too. This might be issue <iref ref="1133"/>. (Howard: confirmed)
</p>
<p>
Move this to Ready, but the Requires clause of the second form of
splice_after should say "(first, last)," not "(first, last]" (there are
three occurrences). There was considerable discussion on this. (Howard: fixed)
</p>
<p>
Alan suggested removing the "foward_last&lt;T. Alloc&gt;&amp;&amp; x"
parameter from the second form of splice_after, because it is redundant.
PJP wanted to keep it, because it allows him to check for bad ranges
(i.e. "Granny knots").
</p>
<p>
We prefer to keep <tt>x</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Beman. Whenever we deviate from the customary half-open range in the
specification, we should add a non-normative comment to the standard
explaining the deviation. This clarifies the intention and spares the
committee much confusion in the future.
</p>
<p>
Alan to write a non-normative comment to explain the use of fully-closed ranges.
</p>
<p>
Move to Ready, with the changes described above. (Howard: awaiting note from Alan)

<p>
Wording below assumes issue <iref ref="878"/> is accepted, but this issue is
independent of that issue.
</p>

<p>
Change <sref ref="[forwardlist.modifiers]"/>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>

<p>
<i>Requires:</i> The iterator following <tt>position</tt> is dereferenceable.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Returns:</i> <del>An iterator pointing to the element following the one that was erased, or <tt>end()</tt> if no such 
element exists</del>
<ins>An iterator equal to <tt>position</tt></ins>.
