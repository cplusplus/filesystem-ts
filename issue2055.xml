<p>
The C++0x draft says <tt>std::accumulate</tt> uses: <tt>acc = binary_op(acc, *i)</tt>.
<p/>
Eelis van der Weegen has pointed out, on the libstdc++ mailing list, that using 
<tt>acc = binary_op(std::move(acc), *i)</tt> can lead to massive improvements (particularly, 
it means accumulating strings is linear rather than quadratic).
<p/>
Consider the simple case, accumulating a bunch of strings of length 1 (the same argument holds for other length buffers).
For strings <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt>, <tt>s+t</tt> takes time <tt>length(s)+length(t)</tt>, as you have to copy 
both <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt> into a new buffer.
<p/>
So in accumulating <tt>n</tt> strings, step <tt>i</tt> adds a string of length <tt>i-1</tt> to a string of length 
1, so takes time <tt>i</tt>.
<p/>
Therefore the total time taken is: <tt>1+2+3+...+n</tt> = O(<tt>n<sup>2</sup></tt>)
<p/>
<tt>std::move(s)+t</tt>, for a "good" implementation, is amortized time <tt>length(t)</tt>, like <tt>vector</tt>, 
just copy <tt>t</tt> onto the end of the buffer. So the total time taken is:
<p/>
<tt>1+1+1+...+1</tt> (<tt>n</tt> times) = O(<tt>n</tt>). This is the same as <tt>push_back</tt> on a <tt>vector</tt>.
<p/>
I'm trying to decide if this implementation might already be allowed. I suspect it might not 
be (although I can't imagine any sensible code it would break). There are other algorithms 
which could benefit similarly (<tt>inner_product</tt>, <tt>partial_sum</tt> and 
<tt>adjacent_difference</tt> are the most obvious).
<p/>
Is there any general wording for "you can use rvalues of temporaries"?
<p/>
The reflector discussion starting with message c++std-lib-29763 came to the conclusion
that above example is not covered by the "as-if" rules and that enabling this behaviour
would seem quite useful.

Moved to NAD Future.  This would be a larger change than we would consider for a simple TC.
