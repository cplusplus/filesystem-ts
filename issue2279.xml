<p>
I think that the effects of <tt>list::splice</tt> function should be stated more carefully.
<p/>
Function transferring a single element is described now in the following way (<sref ref="[list.ops]"/> p7):
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
void splice(const_iterator position, list&amp; x, const_iterator i);
void splice(const_iterator position, list&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator i);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Inserts an element pointed to by <tt>i</tt> from list <tt>x</tt> before position and removes the element from
<tt>x</tt>. The result is unchanged if <tt>position == i</tt> or <tt>position == ++i</tt>. Pointers and references to <tt>*i</tt>
continue to refer to this same element but as a member of <tt>*this</tt>. Iterators to <tt>*i</tt> (including <tt>i</tt> itself)
continue to refer to the same element, but now behave as iterators into <tt>*this</tt>, not into <tt>x</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
But it is incorrect to talk about <tt>operator==</tt> for iterators that are not from the same container (after acceptance of 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3066.html">N3066</a>, <sref ref="[forward.iterators]"/> p2). 
So, the text operates with an undefined behaviour.
</p>

<p>
One is formally allowed to have list implementation where two iterators from different lists return true to <tt>operator==</tt>.
For example, this can only happen to non-dereferenceable iterators, and <tt>position</tt> and <tt>++i</tt> can be 
non-dereferenceable. So, literally according to the standard, it is not allowed in this implementation to transfer 
such elements with <tt>splice</tt> function.
<p/>
State this point carefully:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The result is unchanged if <ins><tt>&amp;x == this</tt> and</ins> <tt>position == i</tt> or <tt>position == ++i</tt>.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[forwardlist.ops]"/> p6 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
void splice_after(const_iterator position, forward_list&amp; x, const_iterator i);
void splice_after(const_iterator position, forward_list&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator i);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
<p/>
-6- <i>Effects:</i> Inserts the element following <tt>i</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>, following <tt>position</tt>, 
and removes it from <tt>x</tt>. The result is unchanged if <ins><tt>&amp;x == this</tt> and the following 
condition is satisfied:</ins> <tt>position == i</tt> or <tt>position == ++i</tt>. Pointers and references to 
<tt>*++i</tt> continue to refer to the same element but as a member of <tt>*this</tt>. Iterators to <tt>*++i</tt> 
continue to refer to the same element, but now behave as iterators into <tt>*this</tt>, not into <tt>x</tt>.
