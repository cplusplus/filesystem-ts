<p><b>Addresses UK 222 [CD1]</b></p>

<p>
It is not clear what purpose the Requirement tables serve in the
Containers clause. Are they the definition of a library Container? Or
simply a conventient shorthand to factor common semantics into a single
place, simplifying the description of each subsequent container? This
becomes an issue for 'containers' like <tt>array</tt>, which does not meet the
default-construct-to-empty requirement, or <tt>forward_list</tt> which does not
support the size operation. Are these components no longer containers?
Does that mean the remaining requirements don't apply? Or are these
contradictions that need fixing, despite being a clear design decision?
</p>

<p>
Recommend:
</p>

<p>
Clarify all the tables in <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/> are
there as a convenience for documentation, rather than a strict set of
requirements. Containers should be allowed to relax specific
requirements if they call attention to them in their documentation. The
introductory text for <tt>array</tt> should be expanded to mention a
default constructed <tt>array</tt> is not empty, and
<tt>forward_list</tt> introduction should mention it does not provide
the required <tt>size</tt> operation as it cannot be implemented
efficiently.

<p>
I just came across issue #1034 (response to UK 222),
which covers the role of container requirements.
The reason I found this issue was that I am wondering why
<tt>array&lt;&gt;</tt> is specified to be a sequence container.
For me, currently, this follows from
Sequence containers <sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>
saying:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The library provides five basic kinds of sequence containers: <tt>array</tt>,
<tt>vector</tt>, <tt>forward_list</tt>, <tt>list</tt>, and <tt>deque</tt>. while
later on in Table 94 "Sequence container requirements" are defined.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
IMO, you can hardly argue that this is NAD.
We MUST say somewhere that either array is not a sequence container
or does not provide all operations of a sequence container
(even not all requirements of a container in general).
</p>
<p>
Here is the number of requirements <tt>array&lt;&gt;</tt> does not meet
(AFAIK):
</p>
<p>
general container requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a default constructed <tt>array</tt> is not empty
</li>
<li>
<tt>swap</tt> has no constant complexity
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 Note also that <tt>swap</tt> not only has linear complexity
 it also invalidates iterators (or to be more precise,
 assigns other values to the elements), which
 is different from the effect swap has for other containers.
 For this reason, I must say that i tend to propose to
 remove <tt>swap()</tt> for <tt>arrays</tt>.
 </p>

<p>
sequence container requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
There is no constructor and assignment for a range
</li>
<li>
There is no constructor and assignment for <tt>n</tt> copies of <tt>t</tt>
</li>
<li>
 There are no <tt>emplace</tt>, <tt>insert</tt>, <tt>erase</tt>, <tt>clear</tt>,
 <tt>assign</tt> operations
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In fact, out of all sequence container requirements <tt>array&lt;&gt;</tt> only
provides the following operations:
from sequence requirements (Table 94):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
X(il);
a = il;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and from optional requirements (Table 95):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
[], at(), front(), back()
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is almost nothing!
</p>

<p>
Note in addition, that due to the fact that
<tt>array</tt> is an aggregate and not a container with
<tt>initializer_lists</tt>
a construction or assignment with an initializer list is valid
for all sequence containers but not valid for array:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
vector&lt;int&gt;  v({1,2,3});   // OK
v = {4,5,6};               // OK

array&lt;int,3&gt; a({1,2,3});   // Error
array&lt;int,3&gt; a = {1,2,3};  // OK
a = {4,5,6};               // Error
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
BTW, for this reason, I am wondering, why <tt>&lt;array&gt;</tt> includes
<tt>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<p>
IMO, we can't really say that <tt>array</tt> is a sequence container.
<tt>array</tt> is special.
As the solution to this issue seemed to miss some proposed wording
where all could live with, let me try to suggest some.
