<p>
Where possible, tuple comparison operators &lt;,&lt;=,=&gt;, and &gt; ought to be
defined in terms of std::less rather than operator&lt;, in order to
support comparison of tuples of pointers.

<p>
If we solve this for <tt>tuple</tt> we would have to solve it for <tt>pair</tt>
algorithms, etc.  It is too late to do that at this time.  Move to NAD Future.

<p>
change 6.1.3.5/5 from:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Returns: The result of a lexicographical comparison between t and
  u. The result is defined as: (bool)(get&lt;0&gt;(t) &lt; get&lt;0&gt;(u)) ||
  (!(bool)(get&lt;0&gt;(u) &lt; get&lt;0&gt;(t)) &amp;&amp; ttail &lt; utail), where rtail for
  some tuple r is a tuple containing all but the first element of
  r. For any two zero-length tuples e and f, e &lt; f returns false.

<p>
to:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Returns: The result of a lexicographical comparison between t and
  u. For any two zero-length tuples e and f, e &lt; f returns false.
  Otherwise, the result is defined as: cmp( get&lt;0&gt;(t), get&lt;0&gt;(u)) ||
  (!cmp(get&lt;0&gt;(u), get&lt;0&gt;(t)) &amp;&amp; ttail &lt; utail), where rtail for some
  tuple r is a tuple containing all but the first element of r, and
  cmp(x,y) is an unspecified function template defined as follows.
</p>
<p>
  Where T is the type of x and U is the type of y:
</p>

<p>
     if T and U are pointer types and T is convertible to U, returns
     less&lt;U&gt;()(x,y)
</p>

<p>
     otherwise, if T and U are pointer types, returns less&lt;T&gt;()(x,y)
</p>

<p>
     otherwise, returns (bool)(x &lt; y)
</p>

<note>
Berlin: This issue is much bigger than just tuple (pair, containers,
algorithms). Dietmar will survey and work up proposed wording.

</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>
Recommend NAD.  This will be fixed with the next revision of concepts.
